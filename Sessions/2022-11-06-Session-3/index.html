All that’s left of the man is a carbon-black scorch mark on the deck plating. It takes you a moment to realize what you’ve done: you’ve killed the leader of one of Calliope’s most notorious pirate gangs. Processing the consequences of that will have to wait, though, as Siren contacts you again. SIREN: “Marines! whatever you just did, the pirates are peeling off, retreating – and we should too! I’m reading a massive bleed in the ship’s mana core, this shift is going to be ugly!”</em></p><h4 id=following-up>FOLLOWING UP</h4><p>The PCs have enough time to return to the <a href=/quartz-lancer-aspect/Dragons-Tooth rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz-lancer-aspect/Dragons-Tooth>Dragons Tooth</a>, but give them a sense of urgency. If they want to grab more salvage, loot or intelligence from the <a href=/quartz-lancer-aspect/Tachyon rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz-lancer-aspect/Tachyon>Tachyon</a>, make them roll a skill trigger. Emphasize the urgency of the situation; <a class="internal-link broken">Siren</a> makes increasingly desperate pleas for the PCs to return to the <a class="internal-link broken">Dragon’s Tooth</a>. Rumbles start to roll down the <a href=/quartz-lancer-aspect/Tachyon rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz-lancer-aspect/Tachyon>Tachyon</a>; the decking starts to rattle and splinter.</p><p><em>Then there is a silent flash of blinding light. The Tachyon and Weasel are gone. You barely have time to grab something before Siren screams for everyone to hard brace. &ldquo;Everybody hold onto your butts!”
You feel can feel the Dragon&rsquo;s Tooth begin to tilt and yaw, mana seizing the space the Tachyon once filled, threatening to bring the Dragon&rsquo;s Tooth into the rift. There’s a tremendous weight on your chest as the sails kick in, and Siren fights the current, pressing you back into the chair. You close your eyes and struggle to breathe. Even with the aid of your hardsuit, you can barely think, mana bleeding around your synapses. The tumble feels like it lasts forever. Blue starts to creep in around the edges of your vision. And then it’s done. It’s over. You’re through. You’re still driting in a spin at about two notts of thrust, but the pressure, that is far more manageable.</em></p><p>You’re able to glance around the cabin, check on your fellow team members, look at your ship’s scry orb.</p><p><em>There’s a moment of calm. Behind you, the Tachyon and the Weasel are gone, Siren comments: &ldquo;likely forever folding between the planes, a thousand pieces tumbling apart, with no binding enchantment to ever draw them home.&rdquo; – and with it you realise, its secrets, the Ardent Weasel, and whatever scorch mark remains of Andros Capella.</em></p><p>Give the PCs a moment to reflect on all they’ve just witnessed before they start the long journey back to <a class="internal-link broken">Hell’s Gate</a>. But don&rsquo;t wait too long, it takes another two weeks to return to Hell’s Gate.</p><h4 id=downtime-1>DOWNTIME 1</h4><p>By then, the news is all over the region: Andros Capella is dead, and the PCs killed him. It doesn’t matter if that’s not what actually happened – the diviners and pirates of Calliope saw the PCs and Andros Capella walk into that ship, and only the PCs walked out. The Hell Hounds have sworn revenge for their slain leader, but rumor has it they’re in serious disarray and in no position to make good on those threats. Getting the weaver part to the city relieves an immense amount of pressure, alleviating the many precarious shortages the city was experiencing.

Expend a charge when you’re on the Icebreaker and not in immediate danger.

Run a few vignettes to explain how they get their new gear. Encourage the PCs to spend time around Hell’s Gate, building on relationships they developed over the course of the chapter.</p><p>The Gate, now in much better repair and under far less strain on its resources, is fully open to them.

The <a class="internal-link broken">Horizon Collective</a> has a subterrainian clinic on the aft-side, and they always seem to be well-stocked.
There’s a thriving grey market among the militia, and there’s always traders in port who might have something you’re looking for.
If nothing else, you can always go trawling through the scrap-yards and trash-heaps – it’s not dignified or hygienic, but even in space, people throw an awful lot of useful stuff away.</p><h2 id=end-of-chapter-1>END OF CHAPTER 1</h2><h1 id=chapter-2-ice-and-fire>CHAPTER 2 &ldquo;ICE AND FIRE&rdquo;</h1><p>A couple of weeks to a month after the PCs return from the Tachyon, Jerry calls them into the briefing room again. Unusually, he asks them to clean up, dress formally and be on their best behaviour for this meeting. When you enter the room, you notice you and Jerry aren’t its only occupants – sort of. The vidscreen displays the flickering image of a severe woman in a crisp white suit. As you arrive, she narrows her eyes. Jerry adjusts his collar nervously.
<em>“So, uh, in case you don’t know, this is Rita, station director on the Icebreaker Borealis. My counterpart!” When she speaks, it’s in a cool, level tone. “Good morning. I’ve heard a lot about you from Jerry and from system gossip. Word is we have you to thank for Andros Capella exiting the stage. Good work! I’m glad Hell’s Gate is finally cleaning up its messes.” Jerry looks upset by this statement, but Rita cuts him off before he can speak. “Let’s get down to business. Jerry says that since you sent the Hell Hounds packing, salvage and mining crews have been able to get to work properly for the first time in months. “Well, you’re in luck. The Icebreaker is undertaking some major expansion projects this quarter, and I’m willing to offer guaranteed, above-market prices for anything you’re selling; raw materials, construction equipment, salvage, whatever. I’ll even comp you and your freighter crews for a few nights on the town. I have one condition.” Jerry takes a deep breath. “You always do, Rita.” Rita shoots a withering glare at Jerry, before continuing. “I want to subcontract your team. I have a very sensitive job that needs a competent crew. You fit the profile, and critically, you’re not working for anyone on the Board.”</em> Rita isn’t the most patient soul in the world, but she does understand the team will probably have a lot of questions, so she politely answers them.</p><h3 id=why-us>WHY US?</h3><p>“Like I said, you’re competent, you’re available, you’re reliable – or so Jerry tells me, at least. But most importantly, you’re not under the thumb of anyone on the Board. That aspect, in fact, is perhaps your most important quality: it means that I can convince the Board to pay you.” She rubs the bridge of her nose irritably. “The Board are a gaggle of paranoid, squabbling toddlers. When anything – and I do mean anything – goes wrong with anyone’s business, they immediately suspect a plot by one of their rivals. And let me clarify: everyone – and I do mean everyone – on the Board are rivals. “They’d never authorise me to hire any member’s private security team for this job, and I can’t trust anyone in the station’s mutual defence force either. I need a small, competent team from outside the Icebreaker’s usual sphere. You killed Andros Capella, and beheaded one of the system’s most dangerous pirate groups. Put simply: you qualify.”</p><h3 id=the-job>THE JOB</h3><p>“I’m going to have to ask you to wait until you arrive on the Icebreaker for specific briefings, but in general terms: I suspect a plot against the Board from an external force. Odd things have been happening recently, both on the station and in our orbital neighbourhood. Power fluctuations, system intrusions, missing persons, traffic irregularities. “Everyone on the Board thinks it’s someone else on the Board, and yes, it’s true they’re always plotting against each other. But this feels different, in a way I can’t quite quantify. Things are happening that wouldn’t benefit anyone in the station’s current order. Customers are discontent. There’s grumbling from residents. Seasonal workers are getting spooked. “No, everyone’s losing money on this. I need you to look into this matter, and put a stop to it. I’m willing to pay top ice to see it done.”</p><h3 id=the-pay>THE PAY</h3><p>“Well, as I previously mentioned, I’ll offer guaranteed prices on everything your station is willing to sell to us. I know the Gate is always in need of cash. “I’ll also open a budget for reasonable expenses. As long as you don’t abuse my generosity too much, you and your freighter crews don’t have to spend a single icicle of your own during your stay. I don’t want anyone – the culprits included – to suspect I’ve brought in outside investigators, so I want you to be seen around the station, spending money like everyone else. It just won’t be your money. “Lastly, I happen to have better contacts than Jerry does, and if you need more powerful hardware, I can hook you up – once I start seeing results, of course.”</p><h3 id=jerrys-opinion>JERRY’S OPINION</h3><p>Jerry scratches his head self-consciously. “My? Opinion? Oh, right. I mean… killing Andros Capella kicked the Hell Hounds real good. They’re making, uh, they’re making all sorts of threats that they’re in no state to carry out. The Gate’ll be, it’ll be fine until you get back. The militia’s got this locked down. “But we could really use money. And… well, the Icebreaker is one of our biggest customers. And they’re offering guaranteed prices on our goods. That’s… that’s pretty good, guys? Plus, plus, Rita knows some people. She can hook you up with mech stuff we just don’t have the budget for. “She can be…” Jerry pauses for a moment, as Rita’s glare sharpens to a razor point. “… cold, sometimes. But you can trust her implicitly.” You see just a split second of emotion pass across Rita’s face, before the stoic mask reasserts itself.</p><h2 id=prior-to-departure>PRIOR TO DEPARTURE</h2><p>The PCs have a little time to spend on Hell’s Gate before they leave. Since they’re about to spend a whole mission away on the Icebreaker, this is a good chance for them to engage with some of the Gate’s NPCs. Here are some suggestions for things that might be going on around the Gate right now:
• Jerry’s stressed, which isn’t unusual, but it seems to be specifically related to Rita. If pressed on the issue, he admits that he used to be involved with her. But then he became station director, and a relationship between two station directors was never going to end well.
• Chief McElroy is watching every single print job like an angry hawk. She says her vigilance is critical to prevent a repeat of the accident that nearly crippled the station. The print team say it’s only preventing an end to the backlog the accident caused.
• Zinfandel is a little concerned about the threats the Hell Hounds have been making, and is stepping up patrols of Stygia’s orbital neighborhood.
• Printloaf wants to expand their selection of seeds, which is running a little thin. The Dragon’s Tooth won’t be subject to the same customs checks that other ships are, which means it’d be easier to run product back from the Icebreaker. Printloaf’s willing to cut the team in on the profits if they help; ten percent is fair, right?
• Samorn Patalung mentions there’s a Horizon Collective repair shop on the Icebreaker. The HORUS dorks who hang out at her stand have talked about wanting to knock it over for a while – go and warn them, maybe?
• Striga Von Aldenberg is inconsolable with worry over the PCs’ safety, insisting that the Icebreaker is “a wretched den of schemes, intrigue and skullduggery.” She’s very coherent today, actually; all the plots and conspiracies that she’s describing are well-evidenced and verifiable. It’s kind of unsettling. Then she goes off about how a secret apocalypse cult has started operating there, and it’s back to business as usual.
• Boss Teka Ashenafi accosts a PC – one who he’s on decent terms with, hopefully – and starts asking pointed questions about mining contracts. He’s heard some rumors on the grapevine about a big job in the system, and he wants to make sure Jerry is putting a bid in for it.</p><p>Give a general impression of how Hell’s Gate is faring at the moment, depending on the status of the Station Stability clock. If it only has a couple of segments ticked, things won’t look great: flickering lights, queues for essential supplies, jury-rigged fixes due to parts shortages, grime and an overall air of melancholy. This isn’t anything new, incidentally; this is just how life on Hell’s Gate usually is. On the other hand, if the clock is at three or four segments, the PCs have been putting in the work, and it’s starting to show. Things look a little cleaner and a little brighter. There’s the parts and the time to make proper repairs. Shortages are easing and people can afford little luxuries. Citizens’ lives are better because of what the PCs did – make sure they know that.</p><p>The journey from Hell’s Gate to the Icebreaker Borealis takes about eleven days. The PCs travel in the Dragon’s Tooth, as one of the escorts for the convoy of freighters hauling metal ingots, polycrete and salvage. Their trip is comfortable and uneventful.</p><p><em>As the cloudy, sand-yellow sphere of Kalevala and its majestic ring system grows in your vision, a small, bright dot grows with it, perched high in orbit. Within hours, that dot resolves into a vast, tangled cylinder of habitats anchored to the remains of an immense mining frigate. The station spills bright neon light into the void, and local space is a hive of activity, dozens of ships arriving and leaving at this very moment. The Icebreaker’s main port works just fine, and docking is a quick and painless process. The fun doesn’t start until you take an elevator down the struts into the Sprawl. In the Grand Concourse that marks the start of the Starstrip, a man is waiting for you – one of the greeters. He explains your hotel reservations, recommends several of the station’s attractions, ensures that you receive all your complimentary gift vouchers, and then very quietly informs you that a meeting has been scheduled for you at lunch tomorrow, in the backroom of the Uncrowned King bar and grille. Until then, you’re told to blend in and enjoy yourselves.</em></p><h2 id=beat-2---a-contract-thriller>BEAT 2 - A CONTRACT THRILLER</h2><p>The PCs have a whole afternoon, evening and morning to themselves. They may each take one DOWNTIME ACTION, as long as it would fit in that timescale. There’s time for a few hours at a casino, a night out drinking, or a morning of networking and seeking out contacts. When the PCs have finished whatever they’re doing before the meeting, Rita is waiting for them at the Uncrowned King.</p><p><em>Rita takes a deep breath. “Alright. I’ve got a lot of things to get through, so listen closely. The situation’s developed since I first called you in, and not in a good way, either.&rdquo;
“Firstly. Two weeks ago, Serendipitous Vitamin, a census officer and a member of my Civic Management bureau, was murdered in his home by a single shot to the back of the head. No signs of struggle or forced entry. Later that evening, his office was ransacked. “The very next morning, just before I called you in, one of Civic Management’s data-centers was raided by a small paramilitary group who we’ve been unable to identify. They took the staff hostage, but no-one was hurt, thank the Buddha. They deleted every record they could get their hands on, trashed the place and then vanished. It was in the middle of a backup cycle, so we’ve lost a week’s worth of data, including the off-site copy of Vitamin’s notes. “Secondly, someone forged my credentials, and wrote a false work order to have repair work done on the Borealis’ main reactor array. They got some… charitable religious group, the Faith of the One Plumed in Golden Flame? Well, they did the repairs. “Then, somehow, Fayad Harb, the boss of the engineer’s union, got word of all of this. Now he’s furious at me because he thinks I used non-union labor, and the entire tech union are on strike. “As if all that wasn’t bad enough, Harrison Armory’s on my case about some missing scientist of theirs. They hold me personally responsible for finding her – as if I’m supposed to keep tabs on two million people visiting my station at any given moment! “Add to that the printers have been going haywire for weeks, there’s power fluctuations, pop-up protests… I’m positive. Someone is fucking with my station. I want them found, and I want them stopped. “Just one issue: the Board hasn’t authorized this operation. They don’t even know about it. I can persuade them to grant ex-post-facto legitimacy once you deliver results, but nobody on the board will sign off on activating you right now. There’s too little trust. In short: stick to investigation until you have a solid lead, and confine your efforts to the Sprawl. I retain the final word on whether or not you deploy mechs. Keep that in your mind at all times. “I’m currently holding your mechs in storage. When you need them, here is a secure contact channel. I’ll need a good justification for the deployment of military hardware on my station before I release them. Understood?”</em></p><p>Rita is happy to provide more detail on any of these topics if the PCs enquire.
At some point in the conversation, Rita is rudely interrupted. It happens quite suddenly: every screen in the room goes blank for a moment, and then displays an emergency alert. Sirens start sounding. Surprisingly, Rita doesn’t panic. Instead, she just groans loudly and buries her head in her hands. After a few seconds, the sirens stop, and everything goes back to normal. <em>“Oh, me cago en diez! They promised me they’d fixed that. No, don’t get up, don’t get up. That’s another thing I was meaning to mention. Every single day, at the exact same time, the station’s general alarm goes off. If all of this other shit wasn’t going on, I’d think it was someone’s sick idea of a joke.”</em></p><h5 id=serendipitous-vitamins-murder>SERENDIPITOUS VITAMIN’S MURDER</h5><p>“I mean, it could have just been a crime of passion, but I don’t buy it. It was premeditated, quiet and professional. He was on to something, and somebody killed him to cover it up. If you need more information, talk to Officer Lamariano.”</p><h5 id=datacentre-attack>DATACENTRE ATTACK</h5><p>“Well, it was probably to destroy Serendipitous Vitamin’s notes before they made it onto an off-site backup. There’s a hostile strike team operating on my station and we can’t keep track of them. I want you to make finding them and shutting them down a priority. Officer Narangerel is head of that investigation. Talk to her.”</p><h5 id=forged-credentials-and-reactor-repairs>FORGED CREDENTIALS AND REACTOR REPAIRS</h5><p>“Let me worry about the forged credentials. What I want you looking into is why someone wanted the reactors repaired. If this was just a charity case, why would they need to fake a work order from me to get them online again? No, nobody does that sort of thing if they have an altruistic motive. “The best people to talk to about this would be members of the tech union. Unfortunately, a whole lot of them are strike right now. I guess you could also talk to the Faith of the One, since they did the repairs. They insist they were just following the work order they got given. Not sure if I trust them, though.”</p><h5 id=fayad-harbs-strike>FAYAD HARB’S STRIKE</h5><p>“I can’t get through to Fayad. And it hurts! He’s one of my closest allies on the Board. He thinks I snubbed him by using non-union labour. Now the [100] engineer’s union is striking, and they’re only responding to emergency callouts. Work is piling up, and visitors are starting to complain. Maybe you’ll have better luck talking to him. “It’s not exactly as if he’ll be hard to find. He’s still protesting right outside my office.”</p><h5 id=missing-harrison-armory-specialist>MISSING HARRISON ARMORY SPECIALIST</h5><p>“Dr. Genevieve Nyambose. She went missing just a day after you left Hell’s Gate. Some specialist researcher or something. The Armory’s threatening legal proceedings against the Board if I don’t get her back. They won’t win, but that’s not the problem: they’re also threatening a boycott, and they’re one of our largest visitor demographics. “If you want to try talking to them, you can speak to Sergeant Hemmingsen. Don’t expect a warm welcome.”</p><h5 id=lack-of-board-authorisation>LACK OF BOARD AUTHORISATION</h5><p>“If I suggested hiring external contractors, each member of the Board would instantly work it into one of their grand conspiracy theories. They’d think I’d lost my neutrality, that I’m plotting with one of them against the rest. So I had to take unilateral action without their approval. “You have to understand my position. The Board is a gaggle of psychotic toddlers, and they all have guns and lawyers. I have to be the one adult in the room, and like any spoilt child, they resent me for it. Every day I wake up and spend dawn ‘til dusk trying to save these puerile dipshits from themselves, often against their will, so they don’t tear this station apart or accidentally dump us into Kalevala’s atmosphere. “Painfully often, I have to justify my actions after the fact, when I don’t have weeks or months to play kindergarten teacher. This is one of those times. I need you to save this station before they know you’re trying to help them, because once they do, they won’t let you.”</p><h5 id=false-alarms>FALSE ALARMS</h5><p>“Every day. Every single day, for the past couple of weeks, at least. I’m this close to just disconnecting the emergency alert system until they can fix it, safety be damned.”</p><h2 id=beat>BEAT</h2><h1 id=summary>SUMMARY</h1><p>After arriving home to Hell&rsquo;s Gate, the
