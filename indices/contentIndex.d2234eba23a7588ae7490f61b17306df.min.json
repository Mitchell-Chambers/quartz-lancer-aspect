Ignatius Aurum has a worryingly good answer. Ignatius was not born to his current name, and he will be the first to admit it; rather, he says, he was reborn to it. Born fifty years ago on the Diasporan planet of Nestor (p. 35), Liddell Ross was a witness to all the cruelties of late-stage capitalist society: poverty, deprivation, resource wars, environmental catastrophe, mass incarceration, racism, homophobia, transphobia and the commodification of every aspect of culture in service of the rich. He watched it all, and in defiance he became an activist, and eventually, a revolutionary. Liddell was one of the Council of Thirty, leadership of the Coalition of Nestorian Citizens, who sent an appeal to Union’s Central Committee, begging them to intercede against the Forefront. It took two years for CentComm to decide Nestor was worthy of its help, two years in which the Coalition’s actions were brutally punished all across Nestor, even though Union knew time was of the essence and their fleet would take a decade to arrive once they were dispatched. Then the Albatross came, and in their biggest series of strategic blunders to date, handed their great war machines and the technology to build more of them over to the Forefront on a silver platter. When Union finally arrived, twelve years after the Coalition’s plea, the ensuing conflict tore Nestor to pieces. Every weapon the Forefront could wield was brought to bear, against Union, against the Albatross, against Nestor’s own people; nobody was spared. The Forefront rained death on any who dared oppose them. Union won in the end; of course it did. Against a galactic superpower, the Forefront never really stood a chance. But Nestor had lost millions of its people to famine, to disease, to war and to the Forefront’s camps. Union wanted the eight known surviving members of the Council of Thirty to help form an interim government, but Liddell wasn’t among them; he’d long since fled. He spent his next few years on Cradle, researching humanity’s history, and it was then he encountered his second great trauma: learning that all of this had happened before, almost verbatim. His struggle was a vivid echo of a struggle people just like him had been fighting for millennia. When he learnt that Union had done its own share of colonialism and fascist violence not too long ago, he could no longer stand living there either, and went into self-imposed exile in the Long Rim. No-one else knows Liddell Ross and Ignatius Aurum are the same person. He'd never imagined getting back into religion; as far as he was concerned, no being that would allow Nestor to happen was worthy of worship. But something about the Faith of the One’s creed made sense to him: a universe that by its natural laws allowed so much as the possibility of the cruelty he’d seen was fatally flawed, had no right to exist, and ought to be replaced. Then, seeing a likely recruitment prospect, the Inner Cult told him that they could make it happen. He had no trouble believing them; he’d seen the apocalyptic chaos of the Nestorian Intervention. He’d seen reality torn to pieces by a cascading NHP. He’d seen a tachyon lance vaporize its target a split-second before it was fired. It was easy enough to believe there was technology that could rewrite the order of the universe. His skill as a public speaker served him well in his public role as a priest and evangelist, while his experience navigating backroom deals and clandestine affairs on the Council of Thirty proved a perfect fit for the Inner Cult’s activity. He quickly rose through the ranks of both the public and secret spheres of his life. Still, through all of it, there was a quiet, gnawing doubt in his heart. After having every hope and faith in his life taken from him, after having every belief he’d ever held revealed as a lie, he lived in constant fear that this too would be taken from him. That fear, that his faith was false and that he was working to uproot the world for nothing, was palpable even in his sermons. But then Feather came. Ignatius Aurum is no longer afraid.","lastmodified":"2022-11-13T05:12:45.176359505Z","tags":null},"/Characters/Hells-Gate/Chief-McElroy":{"title":"","content":"# CHIEF MCELROY\n#### HEAD ARTIFICER \n##### 'HALFLING' FEMALE\nIf McElroy has a first name, either nobody ever uses it or it’s actually “Chief.” A bulky, muscular, dark-skinned woman with close-shaven black hair, a large ocular implant replacing her left eye and a pair of tertiary arms, Chief Engineer McElroy can usually be found smeared in grease and wielding a power tool. Most days, she’s neck-deep in the business of managing the wrenchies and ensuring Hell’s Gate still has air, water and lights. Never one to shy away from hard work, she leads from the front, usually being the first to clock in for shifts and the last to clock out. In truth, she would’ve been a better choice than Jerry to replace Director Bai, and everyone knows it. But everyone also knew that removing her from her current post would be a disaster. Nobody knows their way around the Gate like she does, and losing her handson expertise wasn’t something the station could afford. Despite the pressure placed upon her by her towering work schedule, she’s usually level-headed and rarely loses her cool. Since the recent debacle with the printer, however, she’s become sterner, punishing breaches of maintenance protocol she previously let slide. She’s also made a dire “promise” that, should the printer ever work again, anyone who submits a fabrication without triple-checking it first “will wanna get good at spacewalking real quick.” \n\n## HISTORY WITH PLAYERS\n\n\n## RELATIONSHIPS\n\n\n## SECRETS EARNED\n\n\n## VIBES\n*\"Anyone who submits a weave without triple-checking it first will want to get really immune to breathing mana.\"*^quote\n\n# Tags\n#Female #HellsGate #Halfling","lastmodified":"2022-11-13T05:12:45.176359505Z","tags":null},"/Characters/Hells-Gate/Ipswitch-Delacey":{"title":"","content":"# IPSWITCH \"SWITCH\" DELACEY\n#### ILLUSIONIST SENSATION\n##### GNOME MALE\nThin and pale, with their hair bleached platinum white, Ipswich “Switch” DeLacey is a loud, extroverted bundle of energy. They appeared on the station a few years ago, and promptly took up the career of “lifestyle Omninet streamer.” Since then, Switch and their fleet of camera drones have become a common sight. The fact that they’re often broadcasting live footage of the station’s inner workings and day-to-day events poses a minor security issue for Jerry. It’s likely he’d have shut the whole racket down a while back, were Ipswich not putting half of their stream’s donation money into the station’s discretionary budget. They’re a member of and point of contact for the Horizon Collective – although this seems to be a fact that Ipswich just decided was true, and Horizon grudgingly had to accept. Nonetheless, Ipswich does have a few useful acquaintances in the organization they can put people in touch with. If the PCs seem interesting or cool, Ipswich will try to spend time with them, interview them, or even ride along with them on a mission if one of them has an expanded compartment. Jerry will refuse to authorize this, but there’s little he can actually do to stop the PCs if they take Switch up on this. Switch has a secret; they’re actually Baldur Valentinian, the long-lost son of renowned Armory blinkspace researcher Dr. Odin Valentinian.

A pale, short, thin man with an untidy mop of brown hair and a twitchy disposition, Jerry doesn’t cut a convincing figure. This isn’t helped by his anxiety, his crippling insomnia or his selection of atrocious novelty vests. He always seems to be about thirty seconds away from a nervous breakdown. Under Jerry’s administration, people don’t get very much, but what they’re entitled to, they always get, no matter what. On top of that, Jerry was – likely still is – a top-shelf Chosen.

She’s deeply passive-aggressive towards those she deems to be a bad influence on Jerry. Shelly does not usually provide a visual representation of herself. On the occasions that she does, she projects the image of a smart, youngish woman with glasses, which she continually pushes up when she wants to be condescending. Shelly has an odd fixation: a burning desire to “actually eat food, once, you know?

During an absence of qualified pilots, Siren was given flight control of the Dragon’s Tooth, one of the Gate’s subline corvettes. She excelled in the role, and continues to fill it to this day, ferrying the Strategic Response Team between jobs. As a military asset under SecComm, she cultivated the stern, impatient attitude of a drill sergeant, but in the present era, with the novel experience of being treated as a person instead of a weapon, she demonstrates a more level-headed, outgoing attitude. She has a habit of flipping between these expressions suddenly, often while under stress. She also calls the team “marines,” no matter how many times they ask her to stop. Her casket has eleven tally marks on its casing, but she doesn’t know what they mean. Chained to it is a folder containing emergency protocols in the event of a cascade, and an ad-hoc Balwinder-Bolaño schedule.

She runs on energy drinks and trusts only one convenience store on the other side of the station. Whenever she runs out, she makes “the pilgrimage” all the way from one hab ring to the other to get a new batch, often accompanied by her clique. Judging by their infamous “all -night marathon dance music and gaming parties,” she and the clique are no strangers to stims either. Despite all the quirks, her crew are the station’s most reliable source for obscure data, esoteric software and information retrieval. However, anyone who wants their services is going to have to earn the group’s trust first.

Tall and heavyset, with their sea-green dreadlocks pulled back in a ponytail, Zinfandel cuts an imposing figure to those who first meet them. However, this impression quickly melts away in the face of their boisterous attitude and crude but good-natured sense of humor. They have a whimsical outlook on life, and are prone to pithy, blunt observations. Some of these “DeJeanisms” have dug themselves into the local culture of Hell’s Gate. Zinfandel inherited command of the local militia from Jerry when he became acting director.

Guy at the counter says ‘hey, didn’t I sell you a can of beans twenty minutes ago?’ Man says ‘yeah, but it got all dented.’ Guy at the counter asks ‘how’d it get dented?’ Man says ‘well, I was cavin’ in some shmuck’s skull with it.’ Guy at the counter asks ‘why the hell were you cavin’ in a guy’s skull with a can of beans?!’ Man says ‘well, what was I supposed to do when he wouldn’t give me his can opener?’ So, guy at the counter says ‘well, can’t you just eat the beans outta the dented can?’ Man says ‘buddy, do I look like a savage to you?’” – Andros Capella \n\nWhat could drive a man to desire the end of all things? Andros Capella has no answers, and needs none. Andros Capella believes in nothing. Do not mistake this for a lack of belief in anything: that’s a passive quality. Andros Capella believes in nothing; he’s an active and enthusiastic proponent of the idea that nothing matters, there is no intrinsic value to any entity and that any attempt to imbue meaning is futile. Things that give him a dopamine hit are good; anything else is worthless. Does he have a story, a reason why he? Probably. We could waste time wondering whether Andros Capella had an unhappy childhood and an unkind father, or whether he had a wife and kids at some point who are no longer in the picture. Maybe he had a drinking problem. Maybe he struggled to make ends meet. But none of it matters, because there are hundreds of thousands of people in Calliope with stories just like his, and none of them became gleeful mass murderers. No past could possibly justify what he’s become, and to imply otherwise is an insult to victims of trauma. Most of all, whatever Capella’s past is, it’s as much of a joke to him as everything else; he tells different stories at different times, because it’s funny to watch people sympathize or recoil in horror. It’s a trolling tactic, a way to waste people’s time; he doesn’t care, but he loves making others care. It’s hilarious. The only important factors in his past as far as Calliope is concerned is that he used to run a bar on Hell’s Gate, from which he operated the Hell Hounds, the most infamous group of moonlighter pirates in the system’s history. When they were finally exiled, he turned them into the most infamous group of sunlighter pirates in the system’s history. He has been a plague on the system’s space lanes for twenty-four long years. He's declared himself the Gate’s Public Enemy Number One, and done his level best to live up to that title. In the entire history of the Hell’s Gate volunteer militia, the leading cause of death amongst its membership is encountering a member of the Hell Hounds. Of the Hell Hounds, Andros Capella has the highest kill count, both overall and of Hell’s Gate militia members. Andros is mean-spirited, sadistic, short-tempered and prone to outbursts of explosive anger. It’s difficult to tell whether he just delights in making other people uncomfortable and afraid, or if he genuinely doesn’t understand the way he comes off. At the start of the campaign, Andros Capella is by far the most serious threat to the players. He dies at the end of the first mission. Andros recently encountered a problem: he let Ignatius Aurum preach his hokey religion to the Hell Hounds, and now enough of them have converted to threaten mutiny. Capella wants Aurum gone, but can’t just kill him. Aurum agrees to leave in return for a favor: find an impossible ship, and return it. The players find it first, and in the ensuing fight, Andros is killed. Andros is a character whose presence should be felt even when he’s absent: there are few people more hated or feared throughout the system. There are few things and places in the system not touched in some way by his actions. Taking him out alters the landscape of Calliope in profound ways, most of them good. For the vast majority of people in Lancer, death is the end, but Capella is exceptionally lucky. He has the good fortune to die in a very particular place in a very particular way: consumed by a pillar of flame in the belly of an impossible ship, the former prison of a creature that now believes itself to be an embodiment of death, life and rebirth…","lastmodified":"2022-11-13T05:12:45.176359505Z","tags":null},"/Characters/Rita":{"title":"","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-11-13T05:12:45.176359505Z","tags":null},"/Demographics":{"title":"","content":"Millions of people live in Calliope, possibly even tens of millions. That might not seem like much, given the trillions out there in the galaxy, but it’s plenty big for the Long Rim – a lot of systems don’t top a hundred thousand. And like the rest of the Long Rim, there are people here from everywhere. Folk come to Calliope from all walks of life and from every conceivable place. There are former Metropolitans from Cradle and Tau. There are excolonists from the Dawnline Shore, and refugees from Boundary Garden. There are Sparri, and there are people from all the Houses of the Karrakin. There are people from a thousand worlds, from Unkulukulu in the Malutis to Cadair Idris in the Cascades. Even the Aun are here, exiles of the Ecumene rubbing shoulders with citizens of the Ascendancy. There are also plenty of people who were born here, whose families lived here for generations, all the way back to the first-wave colonists – and those ancestors came from a thousand different worlds, too. All this considered, not much stock is put in the question “are you from around here,” but they care a lot about the question “are you here to help?” Lots of people came to Calliope from all sorts of fancy places, but it doesn’t matter one bit so long as they knuckle down and help with the daily struggle of keeping things running. Being born in Calliope doesn’t make you special, and proudly boasting about being descended from first-wave colonists just means you’ve got two massive rubes in your family tree. There’s an empathy to Calliopeans, despite everything – most understand struggle, because they live it. Despite Union’s best efforts, there are still places out there where the color of your skin, the sound of your voice or the sort of person you love gets you hate. Calliope’s got no time for that. We could all be sucking vacuum tomorrow, and if you can stop that from happening, or at the very least make the hours between then and now happy ones, you’re welcome, and fuck anyone who says otherwise.","lastmodified":"2022-11-13T05:12:45.176359505Z","tags":null},"/Downtime-Action":{"title":"","content":"If a player is in the location, or can reasonably reach the location within the Downtime provided to them, they are free to take the following context specific actions.\n\n# Hell's Gate Outpost\n\n#### PITCH IN \nYou volunteer for extra work shifts and get down to the difficult business of keeping Hell’s Gate running for another week. It’s tiring, dangerous and often thankless. But this is work that someone needs to do, and if nobody volunteers, you’re all just drifting. Explain the work you’re putting in and roll: On 9 or less, you do more to hinder than help. You get in the way, make poor decisions or distract other workers. After a couple of days of this, you’re asked not to show up for shifts anymore. Take +1h to interactions with the Gate’s residents until the next downtime. On 10-19, with a staggering amount of effort, and many nights with too little sleep, you’re able to make some headway in tackling the station’s innumerable problems. Gain +1g on interactions with Hell’s Gate residents until the next downtime. On 20+, not only do you solve a major problem that was causing a lot of people grief. Tick one segment on the Station Stability clock, and gain +1g on interactions with Hell’s Gate residents until the next downtime. If multiple characters take this action, roll once for each character and take the best result instead of applying each result individually. The Station Stability clock only gets incremented once, but social bonuses or penalties apply to all participating characters.\n\n#### GO CUBBYING \nYou strap on a mobility hardsuit, pack a few rations and set off into the station’s abandoned sectors. Some only have emergency lighting. Some are without power. Some aren’t even pressurized. But all of them have something interesting hidden inside, if you can find it. Describe your exploration, then roll: On 9 or less, you get trapped behind a security door, stuck in a vent or just hopelessly lost. You’re forced to call for rescue. Jerry tearfully chews you out for setting a bad example, and has a maintenance team seal off a few common access points that cubbyers use. No other PC can take this action until next downtime, and you become persona non grata at the Gate’s cubbying club. On 10-19, you find something interesting on your explorations: a forgotten cache of supplies, a functional console with useful data, an access card to a door nobody’s been able to open, or something like that. You can treat these as RESERVES, as useful materials for a future downtime action like Get Creative, or as currency to give you +1g on a few social rolls. On 20+, not only do you find a bunch of useful stuff, you actually discover something in a forgotten corner of the station that’s been causing a bunch of those problems the wrenchies couldn’t figure out how to fix. You get all the benefits of a 10-19 result and you tick one segment on the Station Stability clock. Jerry finally eases up on the whole cubbying deal, so the station’s cubbying club now thinks you’re rad as fuck. The Station Stability clock can only increment once per downtime from this action, but any number of characters can roll this activity separately and reap its other benefits. \n\n#### TAKE A BREAK \nJerry has added a few days leave to your file – a rare privilege on Hell’s Gate. You decide to spend some of them right now, de-stress and recharge your batteries after the hectic few weeks you’ve had. Explain how you’re de-stressing, and then roll: \nOn 9 or less, you just can’t switch off. It’s hard to sleep, and nothing seems to help. You have a rough few days. But one morning, you wake up, step outside and find a little care package with some of your favorite snacks inside. There’s a little note signed by more than sixty people. It says “thank you for keeping us safe.” One of the kids drew your mech. They really do care. \nOn 10-19, you feel a bit of the weight lift off your shoulders. You catch a good night’s sleep for the first time in ages. Oh, and you made a friend! The GM can roll on the Additional NPCs table from Beat 1: All Ye Who Enter (p. 60), or invent their own. \nOn 20+, you feel better than you’ve felt in years! You’re more ready to face the world than you ever were before. Take two counters. They represent a well of renewed confidence. During the next mission, you can spend a counter on an attack, check or save you make to treat the result of the d20 roll as a 10. \n\n#### JOIN A CREW \nNow that the scanning array is back online and the pirates are out of the way for a while, salvage and mining runs are starting up again. You check your hardsuit seals, pack your bag, join a crew and spend a couple of weeks out in a wreck or an asteroid cluster. If you’re not the mining or salvaging type, you can still bring your mech, keeping the team safe while they work; guardians get a cut, just like everyone else. Create a six-segment Salvage clock on your character sheet, then roll: On 9 or less, fill in one segment on the Materials clock. On 10-19, fill in two segments on the Materials clock, and gain one item of particular interest. Roll 1d20 to see what you find. This can be used as Reserves, pilot gear, or to gain +1g on a couple of relevant skill checks. On 20+, due to your stellar performance on this run, the team votes you for first pick. Fill in three segments on the Materials clock, then roll 2d20, choosing one result. From now on, you can clear segments on the Salvage clock for the following benefits: • 1 segment: Gain +1g on one skill check to invent, create or repair items, or on one skill check to barter, negotiate or bribe. • 2 segments: During any downtime, gain one piece of Mech Equipment and Gear (Lancer, p. 51) as Reserves. • 6 segments: During any downtime on Hell’s Gate, tick one segment on the Station Stability clock.\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-13T05:12:45.176359505Z","tags":null},"/Dragons-Tooth":{"title":"","content":"The team has access to the Dragon’s Tooth HG-0451, an old IPS-N Sunfish Mk. III multirole corvette. It will serve as their transport for the entire campaign. IPS-N designed the Sunfish as an affordable corvette for civilian space administrations. It was built from the ground up as a modular platform, with a standard airframe that provided the basic necessities and a variety of expansion kits to add specific functionality. It proved so wildly popular that it went through five design revisions, and despite being nearly two centuries old is still being manufactured and supported. The Dragon’s Tooth started life as SMP Local Supply Tender 0451. It served in this function for nearly two hundred years, until it and several other corvettes were modified as part of Director Bai Zexian’s efforts to restore the strength of the militia following the Demon Winter of 4992, where nearly half the militia was lost due to defection to the Hell Hounds pirate gang or the ensuing fighting that exiled the gang from the station. As it currently stands, the Dragon’s Tooth has earned a bit of a legend throughout Calliope: it always scrapes through. It’s been in eighteen fights and taken a hit in every single one, but it’s always been on the winning side. It’s been patched up, overhauled and repaired so many times there’s not much of the original ship left. When the PCs start the campaign, the Tooth is in rough shape: it has a nearlight drive, but none of the internal equipment required to allow humans to survive a bolt. What few armaments it has are just undersized mech weapons bolted to the hull. At the start of the campaign, the ship does not have sufficient firepower to deliver Bombardment; they will have to arrange alternate means if they want use of that RESERVE. Its only major perks are its NHP-C module, which contains its pilot, Siren, and its trans-atmospheric flight suite, allowing it to enter, leave and operate within planetary atmospheres. For game convenience, the ship always has enough room to carry the entire team, even if their mechs are all Size 3 and even if it’s carrying other cargo.

In fact, it might be the most wellknown system in the Long Rim, occupying space in the public consciousness far beyond its political relevance. Its largest, most profitable cultural export is mech combat. The kind of live-fire mech brutality the galaxy craves is illegal to conduct in most Union jurisdictions, but it’s perfectly legal to watch. If you’re a decent fighter, there’s money to be made making your robot punch other robots. Arenas dot the system, although the vast majority are on the Icebreaker Borealis. There are three major leagues in Calliope, known as the Three Elements. The Moon Glacier League is sponsored by the Board of Icebreaker, and as such has an extravagant budget and lavish production quality. The Thunderstorm League is sponsored jointly by SSC and IPS-N, and so tends to feature a lot of their mechs. Hell’s Gate’s Hellfire League is entirely revenue-funded with no major sponsors, so tends to be the least profitable, but is supported by a large contingent of purists who consider it a more “authentic” experience. There are also a large number of omni shows set in Calliope. It’s a popular place to set dramas and thrillers, and this contributes to Calliope’s cultural visibility. However, none of these shows are actually filmed in Calliope, nor do they employ Calliopean writers or actors, nor do Calliopeans receive any of their profits. There was a recent scandal where it came to light that Ultima Ratio Motion Pictures had built a to-scale, fully operational replica of Hell’s Gate for filming the third season of The Life Incandescent. As Calliopean political omnicaster Kady Amville put it: “they will spend so much money to not pay us any money.” Another problem arises from Calliopean representation existing almost entirely outside their control: people form opinions about Calliopeans based on what outsiders write about them. The omni dramas portray Calliope as a place rife with deprivation and violence – which, to be fair, it is. But moments of Calliopean joy, solidarity and warmth are rarely seen. There’s an almost pornographic obsession with human suffering, portraying all Calliopeans as either victims, criminals or a razor-thin margin of troubled anti-heroes. In recent years, however, Calliopeans have started to speak for themselves. Calliopean music, poetry and fiction, having already achieved subcultural success in Union, is going mainstream. The explosive popularity of Calliopean omnicasts such as Kady Amville’s Oh, And By The Way or Ipswich “Switch” DeLacey’s Live From The Long Rim have inspired other omnicasters throughout the system. The Board of Icebreaker is bankrolling its own motion picture studio, which promises to employ only local talent and writers.","lastmodified":"2022-11-13T05:12:45.176359505Z","tags":null},"/Factions/Barons-of-Hob":{"title":"","content":"To say that the Baronies are not well-liked in Calliope would be a dangerous understatement.

Holval's Kingdom was at least as guilty as the Hobs, but the Kingdom had better propagandists. The Armory’s part in the terrible hardships of the Void Age couldn’t be erased, but it could be downplayed, especially if their hated rivals the Karrakin could serve as a scapegoat. Karrakin living in Calliope (“Callikin”) have to be wary of their conduct. Calliopeans are, by and large, sensible enough to separate people from their government. But they aren’t perfect, and if someone is perceived to be flaunting Baronic loyalties too freely, they’re liable to find themselves ostracized. It doesn’t help that the definition of “flaunting Baronic loyalties too freely” often seems to be fluid. So, given the risk of prejudice, why might a Karrakin want to live here? Well, counter-intuitively, that very prejudice makes it a great place to hide. \n\nAnyone who can keep their mouth shut about Of the Great Houses, the Houses of Stone, Dust and petitioner Promise are the most well-represented, simply by dint of proximity to the Dawnline Shore; of that cohort, the majority are Dust refugees fleeing the nanite consumption of Bo, Dust’s homeworld.

This belief, cynical thought it might be, isn’t untrue. Union’s responsibilities are immense, spanning hundreds of countries and near a billion people.

Despite her coldness, Rita really does have the interests of the Icebreaker’s people at heart; after all, someone has to. Of the many weapons in her arsenal, Rita’s two greatest are her ability to make her goals seem beneficial to others, and her ability to hide her motives. She knows how to make people think they came up with her schemes themselves, and she can do it without tipping her hand. These skills are essential for convincing the Board to do anything, as they perceive any idea or agenda other than their own as a threat. As Rita herself would explain it to the few people she trusts, “never have your own ideas. Just have all of theirs for them.” She’s tall and severe, with immaculately coifed black hair and a steely gaze. She wears glasses, although she doesn’t need them, and a snow-white suit with lines so sharp they’d put the Terashima Enclave to shame. She radiates an aura of effortless calm and superiority. If you were to remark to her that she’s a contrast to Jerry Masters in every single way, she’d laugh and agree with you, then frown and tell you never to compare her to him again. As an employer, Rita doesn’t micromanage. She hires people who’ve proven their competence, tells them precisely what she wants, tells them what they need to know, and then trusts them to work out how to do it. The only thing she wants is the result she asked for: how you get it is usually unimportant. She always pays what she owes promptly, and never forgets a favor.\n\nFAYAD HARB \nHE/HIM\nICEBREAKER ENGINEERING UNION CHIEF \nPeople look at the Icebreaker’s glittering neon dreamscape and call it magical – and that view tends to make them think everything here happens by magic. But it doesn’t. It takes thousands of man-hours of backbreaking labor every day to keep this tangled engineering nightmare running, and if you let the people up top forget that for even a second, everyone suffers. Enter people like Fayad Harb. Fayad and a small number of other union bosses sit on the Board as a counterbalance to the executives and commercial interests that otherwise tend to dominate it. The rest of the Board would dearly like to get rid of them, but the saving grace of the Icebreakers’ unions is that there’s so much enmity and distrust between the station’s elite that their anti-union initiatives are scattershot and ineffective. A short, energetic man, Fayad sports a permanent tenday beard, missing a section directly under his chin. His hair’s mostly silver, despite the fact that he doesn’t look that old. He’s friendly to those he trusts, but can get quite vicious with people he disapproves of. He assumes any action by the wealthier members of the Board is a threat to his people; an uncharitable outlook, but rarely wrong. He refrains from drink, but smokes almost constantly, even while working. \n\nKILEYNA MORTON \nTHEY/THEM \nUNION LIASON TO CALLIOPE \nIt took almost a century for Calliope to cross the desk of anyone at the Union Administrative Bureau. They promptly deemed the system too unimportant to warrant sending an Administrator, and fobbed the system off on the Bureau of Orbital and Non-Terrestrial Management, who sent a civilian liaison. Kileyna is the eighth appointee to this position. Short and bronze-skinned, their dark hair has a few streaks of white despite the fact that they don’t look a day over twenty-five. They tend to dress in muted colors, usually including at least an element of grey, and they have an unconscious habit of rubbing their right thumb against their left middle finger when they’re stressed. They’re empathetic and happy to listen, but they have to maintain a level of detachment for their own mental health. Every day, they hear the woes of a great number of people, and they can’t always help. Kileyna has a difficult job: to represent Union and its utopian goals in a place defined by the absence of both. Almost everyone in Calliope resents Union in some way. Many resent that there’s widespread suffering and hardship that Union could fix, but doesn’t. An equal number resent the idea of Union chipping away at Calliope’s independence. There’s folk out here who personally remember the days of SecComm, and don’t trust Union because of it – and an unsettling few who are upset those days are past. This isn’t helped by Union’s general opinion on the Long Rim: that its humanitarian issues could be solved if it just stopped existing, and everyone was relocated somewhere nicer. Kileyna advocates for an organization that wants to make their job obsolete to people who despise it; an irony their critics delight in.\nWith those difficulties in mind, Kileyna’s work ethic is exemplary. It’s down to their tireless, thankless effort that Union assigns an aid budget to Calliope at all. The neutral omninode, bringing omninet access to all without a price tag, is an accomplishment of theirs. They got a Union Navy carrier assigned to the system, and the naysayers called it “overreach,” while at the same time whining that it wasn’t a full battlegroup. In their darker moments, they remind themselves: doing good is its own reward, even if nobody thanks you.\n\nIRVIN REID \nHE/HIM \nTHE VOICE OF ICEBREAKER PUBLIC RADIO \nIf you’ve tuned into public channels in Calliope, you’ve heard Irvin Reid. He has a voice that could melt butter and a wit to back it up. In defiance of radio tradition, he looks exactly like he sounds: tall, dark, handsome, and settling into middle age with practiced dignity. He’s also one of the few human beings who can pull off a fedora. He has an almost mystical way of describing day-today news, making situations seem at once vivid and deeply relatable. He has a reputation for refusing to sugar-coat or pull his punches, but also for avoiding hyperbole; his descriptions might veer fantastical on occasion, but he still tells it exactly as it is. Irvin is one of Rita’s closest allies. She convinced the Board to sponsor Icebreaker Public Radio, while keeping it free of corporate influence, making it one of the most trusted news sources in the system. \n\nSMITH JOHNSON \nTHEY/THEM \nIPS-N REGIONAL MANAGER \nSmith Johnson is the highest-ranking IPS-N employee in Calliope. This is a punishment far beyond simple reassignment to the Long Rim, which happens to any number of IPS-N staff who make one too many screwups. No, Smith’s job is much worse: they’re responsible for all these rejects now. So far as IPS-N is concerned, any further mistakes they make are Smith’s fault. Paunchy, middle-aged, with thinning hair, Smith routinely overindulges to deal with the immense stress of their job. They wear a vast array of dataplating so that they never miss a beat; there’s always some fire that needs putting out, and the longer they leave it, the hotter it burns. They’re always exhausted, and it shows. Despite their desperate position, Smith’s been able to celebrate a couple of victories. It’s not exactly the most profitable deal ever, but the small-fleet contract with Hell’s Gate generated substantial goodwill. Trunk Security has seen an uptick in contracts, too. Surely, there’s got to be something they can do to convince IPS-N they’re not a total loser? Smith is likely who the PCs will talk to should they have dealings with IPS-N. If they seem like they have money, Smith is almost pathetically eager to please.\n\nLOKI VALENTINIAN \nHE/HIM \nTHE PRODIGAL SON \nA pale youth with messy black hair, a winning smile and a twinkle of mischief in his eyes. His entire being exudes a constant, infectious energy. He never seems to be able to sit completely still, some part of his body always moving – usually his hands, fiddling with a pen or some part of his uniform. Loki is a Harrison Armory corporal, and one of the few friendly members of the Armory the PCs are likely to meet in the near future. If the PCs engage Loki in conversation, while he’s happy to talk, he tries to avoid saying anything about himself. However, if he thinks holding back will lose the PCs’ trust, he’ll open up a little. He’s the son of Dr. Odin Valentinian, a prestigious Armory executive and weapons designer. There was a terrible accident at the research facility during a test of one of his father’s prototypes, and his twin brother Baldur was lost. Loki blames Odin for Baldur’s death, and signed up with the Legion to get away from it all. But now he’s learnt that his father is coming out to Calliope for some reason, and Loki definitely doesn’t want to be here when he arrives. Speaking about his family is the only thing that dims Loki’s smile. \n\nHOWL \nSHE/HER \nREIGNING HELLFIRE LEAGUE CHAMPION \nA towering, muscular woman, her skin covered in tattoos of wolves and other lupine creatures. She’s a regular in all three of the Icebreaker’s mech-fighting circuits and reigning champion of the Hellfire League (during Act 1, at least). Despite theming her brand around wolves, she sincerely believes they’re mythical creatures that never actually existed, and will not believe any evidence to the contrary, up to and including living wolves on dozens of Core worlds. As a trans woman and a refugee from Nestor, she’s become somewhat of a folk hero to Nestorians: one of their own, out there in the stars, thriving despite being the exact sort of person the Forefront wanted dead. She’s very vocal about her heritage, and often lends her voice to the cause of the Nestorian diaspora, both in Union and in Calliope. When not in the cockpit, she can be found gambling her winnings in the Icebreaker’s casinos, doing promotional work for her various sponsors, or working out.\n\nEVELINA BONDARCHUK \nSHE/HER \nOWNER OF THE GIFT-BRONZE CASINO \nA regal woman with a taste for elegant and complex dresses. She’s never seen without a cigarette in a long holder, but never seems to actually light or smoke it. She’s spent years cultivating an air of mystery and allure largely just to see if she could; she’s uninterested in actual intimacy or romantic involvement. As a casino proprietor and a member of the Board, Evelina is no stranger to intrigue. She’s become exceptionally good at navigating the Icebreaker’s brutal, cut-throat politics, but she has an extra secret: she’s thrown in with Ignatius Aurum and the Inner Cult. Evelina’s primary advantage is that she possesses all the strengths of a Board member and almost none of their usual weaknesses. She has immense wealth, prestige and access, and she’s intimately familiar with how to navigate the short-sighted greed and vicious social games of the other Board members. But she’s no longer in a chaotic free-for-all: she has a definite goal, and allies whom she can trust.\n\nVIMALA “MISS HIGH ROLLER” PREMJANI \nHer main claim to fame is being banned from every casino on the Icebreaker. They say she’s a cheat. She insists she’s just good at counting cards and weighing probabilities. Since she can’t make money gambling anymore, she offers divination with tarot cards, which is inexplicably reliable. \n\n3-4 PLACEHOLDER MCPLACEHOLDERSON PLACEHOLDER \n\n5-6 TALON KYLE DIAMZON MECHANIC \nA wrenchie who got fired from his job at Impact Dynamics for sneaking repair supplies to “the poors,” and so took his services to the Icebreaker. Has a massive charitable streak, and spends as much time fixing things for free as he does for pay. \n\n7-8 SUBTEXT ÍSFÛR COWARDS \nAn argumentative philosopher who got stuck on the Icebreaker when their colony ship left without them for some reason. Subtext makes a living giving philosophy lectures, as they (allegedly) have teaching qualifications. While their debate style is often needlessly aggressive, they make a compelling point about how a lot of academic philosophy has become “navel-gazing bullshit that’s lost touch with the day-to-day struggles people in the real world experience.” \n\n9-10 ISHIHARA YAEKO \nA painter suffering from a long artistic block. She’s searching for new inspiration, and if any of the PCs capture her attention, she’ll begin asking about their experiences and trying to spend time with them. If she gets to know a PC, she’ll share something personal: ever since she came to Calliope, she’s been having recurring nightmares of her wife dying. Just one problem: she’s not and has never been married. \n\n11-12 JÓN JÓNSSON \nA smart-looking businesswoman who insists she’s just taking an “extended vacation” on the Icebreaker, which has lasted about a decade so far. Despite the fact that she doesn’t seem to have a job, she never seems to be short of cash, and can be found in the station’s mid-market casinos, making low-cost wagers and sipping high-cost drinks. If a PC earns her trust, it turns out she’s a grey-market fixer, and is happy to hook them up with interested clients or vendors. \n\n13-14 YELDA ERGUN \nWait, the Yelda Ergun? From Yelda and the Minesweepers? The pop sensation that swept musical awards five albums running? The multi-instrumentalist virtuoso whose posters graced the bedroom walls of half the teenagers in Union? What’s she doing working as a barista in a crummy cafe in the Long Rim? Well, she says, burnout’s a motherfucker. Add in a control freak manager, an argument with a bandmate that turned violent, the paparazzi and a literal cult of obsessive stalkers, and running away became less about luxury and more about necessity. Now, can she please just take your order? \n\n15-16 RAT \nPierced in every place you can imagine (and, he assures you, some you can’t), covered in tattoos, with his hair dyed any number of colors, Rat cuts an imposing figure despite his short stature. He originally turned to sex work to cover the cost of his gender confirmation surgery, but found that not only did he enjoy the profession, there were a lot of people in it who needed solidarity. Sex work on the Icebreaker has never been easy, but at least if you ask “Little Rat Boy” for help, he can make certain problems – like abusive clients or pushy debt collectors – go away. \n\n17-18 ANTHONY “CAL” CALLAHAN \nA scruffy man with long brown hair and a green spiral tattooed around his left eye. He wears a bullet on a chain around his neck, speaks in an older dialect of Union Common, and has the haunted, suspicious look of someone on the run from the authorities. Always wears a fingerless glove on his left hand, apparently to conceal something. Makes a living doing sleight of hand and magic tricks that genuinely seem to be impossible. \n\n19-20 SIDAR OMÊD AUGHT-TEN-SIX \nAn older man with some gnarly facial scars; energy weapon, maybe? He’s an electrical engineer, and part of Fayad Harb’s engineering union, but is much more radical than Harb. There are some rumors that connect him to unauthorized industrial sabotage – only rumors, mind, but he never denies them.","lastmodified":"2022-11-13T05:12:45.176359505Z","tags":null},"/GM/Characters/Jerry-Masters":{"title":"","content":"![[../../Characters/Hells Gate/Jerry Masters]]\n\n## THE TRUTH\nDespite all of this, Jerry really is trying his best to keep the station running.

Every member suspects every other member of trying to pull a scam: after all, it’s what most of them are doing themselves. Anything one member suggests, others oppose on general principle. Important decisions sit paralysed by squabbling for weeks, months or even years. The city's Chancellor, Rita, is a cool, calculating woman who stays in her position through a combination of compromise and cunning. Although she’s supposed to be answerable to the city's entire populace, she is reliant on the Council to actually get anything done. This gives Rita both a great degree of operational leeway and almost none: the Council genuinely don’t care about the decisions she makes – unless they might somehow interfere with profits. Most positive changes on the Icebreaker are a result of Rita manipulating members of the Council into seeing something she wants as a scam, but one she’s letting them in on. This is how the Icebreaker has an uncensored newspaper, free canal transit and a variety of affordable public services: Rita tricked the Council into funding them, thinking it was some sort of racket they could use to get a leg up on the competition. The Council has a large mutual mercenary force to protect the station, its guests and its permanent residents, but most of the richer members retain their own private guards, just in case. The Council will probably serve as allies to the PCs, but unreliable ones. Yes, saving Calliope is a mutual interest, but how can it be monetized?\n\nCORE MISSION\nRetain the Icebreaker’s coveted reputation as the premier destination for rest and relaxation in the Far Planes.\nMake a tidy profit by selling distraction as a service.\nAvoid anything that’s going to scare away customers, like getting involved in region politics at all, ever.","lastmodified":"2022-11-13T05:12:45.176359505Z","tags":null},"/GM/Plotting/ACT-1":{"title":"","content":"## Session Breakdown\nChapter 1\nSession 1 - Combat 1-1 and 1-2\nSession 2 - Combat 1-3\n\nChapter 2\nSession 3 - Downtime, Mission Prep, Roleplay\nSession 4 - Combat 2-1 and 2-2\nSession 5 - Combat 2-3 and 2-4\nSession 6 - Either Downtime or Crisis Control on Icebreaker\n\nChapter 3\nSession 7 -\nSession 8 -\nSession 9 -\nSession 10 -\n\nChapter 4\nSession 11 -\nSession 12 -\nSession 13 -\nSession 14 -\n\nChapter 5\nSession 15 -\nSession 16 -\nSession 17 -\nSession 18 -\n\nGive or take 3 Sessions\n\n\n## Chapter Summaries\nChapter 1 - The Tachyon Returns starts with a crisis on Hell’s Gate: the station’s only mana weaver is broken, and its absence is already causing major problems.

You open your eyes, and then close them again. It feels like you just laid down. It can’t possibly be morning already. Just five more minutes, surely. The alarm sounds again, and you curse all your ancient ancestors for unlocking the secrets of fire, wheeled locomotion and digital chronometers. You’re tired, so deeply tired, and you want to sleep in today. The alarm sounds yet again, and defeated, you surrender and haul yourself out of bed. You immediately bash your head on the ceiling of your bunk. You always forget. Your cabin is cramped like a prison cell, three and a half meters long, two meters wide and two meters tall, and it has to cram a bunk, a desk, storage bins, a personal console, a shower-toilet cubicle and your hardsuit locker into that space. You know what, scratch that prison cell thing – not even the cruelest brig designer would make a hole this cramped. But keep your perspective here: as far as this station goes, you live in luxury. You have all this space to yourself, your own shower and your own toilet. Most people in the Gate are living two to a room, and they all have to share the facilities with three other cabins. Thank goodness you know how to pilot a mech, right? That’s what gets you a whole seven square meters to call your own. You grope in the darkness for the light switch, and it flickers. Once, twice, three times, and you feel your heart sink in the split seconds of darkness, but then it flares to life, and you feel only a moment of relief. It took maintenance a week to fix the lights last time they did this. Something to worry about later. You grab your dataslate and check today’s work schedule. Yep, even though you’re a pilot, they can’t just have you sitting around idle on days you aren’t in the cockpit. There’s always something going wrong on the station, and you’ve presumably got a pair of hands that can hold a wrench. Today you’re on air filter duty with the rest of your fireteam – dirty, ugly work, little better than wastewater maintenance. Might as well not bother with the shower until you’re finished. You fish out a reasonably clean jumpsuit, clamber into it, then grab your sturdiest pair of work boots and start to lace up. Welcome, as they say, to another day in Hell.*\n\n## BEAT 1 - ALL YE WHO ENTER HERE\nYou step out of your cramped little cabin, into another day full of backbreaking toil just to keep Hell’s Gate alive. Everything’s falling apart. The foundries run at lower efficiency every week. The heat management system is half a century past due for replacement. People report which part of the station they’re in by reading the error code off the nearest computer screen. The vent crab infestation is so bad some people have suggested just training them to show up for work shifts. There’s been power failures in Section 3B every day for a month. Oh, and last week, the printer broke, so there’s that. \n\n### RISE AND SHINE \nStart by introducing the players to Hell’s Gate – it will be their characters’ home for most of the campaign, so they should get familiar with it. The PCs have lived here long enough to get recruited into the station militia’s Strategic Response Team, so have them play out a few scenes and vignettes showcasing the station, their characters, and the relationship between both. \n\n### STATION OVERVIEW \nHell’s Gate consists of a swarming maze of material processing facilities about seven kilometers long, capped on each end by a docking bay and a rotating habitation ring. Directions on Hell’s Gate are usually referred to in reference to “fore” and “aft,” referring to the forward and rear docking bays and hab rings. The fore of the station was supposed to point in the general direction of whatever it was mining, ideally with the aft pointing away from Stygia’s gravity well. The last time the station had its facing adjusted was an emergency maneuver more than half a century ago, and nobody knows if it would survive a repeat performance. Mag-train lines run the length of the mid-station, allowing quick transport of goods and personnel across the station. It usually takes about twenty minutes for a mag-train to go from fore to aft, stopping at every terminal, but a militia emergency override can get you anywhere on the track in just under five minutes. Jerry frowns on misuse of this privilege. There are safe thoroughfares for “on-foot” personnel, but rare is the Gater who wants to travel seven kilometers in zero-g unassisted. The station was designed back when mechanized chassis were first becoming common, and so there are specially-rated train cars large enough to carry four Size 1 mechs or two Size 2 mechs. Size 3 mechs weren’t a thing at the time, but you can just about squeeze one of them into a car if it’s lying down. Since mechs aren’t usually needed outside the docking bays, the mech cars aren’t used often. The hab rings are just over 1400 meters in diameter, rotating at 1.1 rotations per minute. The rings spin oppositionally, clockwise from the perspective of someone looking out of their associated docking bay. This motion is tuned to provide a more or less perfect 1g of artificial gravity, although it’s fast enough that some sensitive individuals (mostly visitors) get motion sickness, or “the spins.” Directions on the rings are “spin” and “antispin,” with “down” pointing outwards from and “up” pointing inwards to the axis of spin. The rings are divided into three decks, with the upper deck being dedicated mostly to agricultural spaces and grow houses, the middle deck to habitation and business and the lower deck to maintenance and life support. Hell’s Gate has several kinetic and directed-energy weapons mounted on turrets across its hull, designed to give full coverage against encroaching debris, rock fragments and micrometeoroids. Although they aren’t officially rated for the purpose, they can also put holes in pirate mechs and subline vessels if need be. The station used to have a long-range mining laser mounted above the fore docking bay, but during the Demon Winter of 4992, the Hell Hounds stole it as they fled. Andros Capella mounted it on a turret at Fort Cerberus as a directional superweapon. The Gate maintains its own omninode, allowing station residents to access the omninet in real time, rather than relying on light-speed delayed broadcasts from the Union Neutral Omninode near Calliope’s star. The station also has a backup internal communications grid that uses rotary-dial telephones and teleprinters. It’s not cutting-edge, but it’s reliable, impossible to jam and stays operational even during station-wide blackouts. [54] [55] \n\n### LOCATIONS \n#### FORWARD DOCKING BAY \nThe Gate’s forward docking bay (colloquially, “the Mouth”) was meant to be oriented towards whatever the station was currently mining, but that was a long time ago. Mining vessels would arrive, drop off their raw ore, refuel and leave for another run while the ore was funneled into the station’s cavernous refineries. At its peak, the station was sending out five or six ships every day. Nowadays it’s lucky to get a couple out in a week. \n\nFORWARD HAB RING \nThe forward hab ring is by far the least well-maintained of the two, a fact that rankles the station’s Miners Union something fierce given that most of them live there. It’s still airtight, but there’s leaks in both the potable and waste water lines and the various grow-houses and hydroponics farms are pinched by materials shortages that don’t seem to hit the aft ring as hard. Jerry’s not blind to these problems, though; he lives here too. \n\nINDUSTRIAL SECTOR \nThe middle of the station is occupied by a long tangle of refineries, smelters, foundries and chemical plants. With all units online and functioning at peak efficiency, Hell’s Gate could render tens of thousands of tons of ore per hour into metal ingots, gravel, graphene and fullerenes. Nowadays, it’s barely operating 8%, and those aren’t working even close to peak due to staff shortages and a lack of maintenance. If Jerry hadn’t given himself a stomach ulcer negotiating with IPS-N for replacement parts, it’d be 4%, if that. OPS Part of the aft midstation is set aside for the Gate’s operations division. The station’s bridge is here, along with its omninode, primary reactor array, mainframes and harbor control. Aside from Central Fabrication, this is the most secure and well-armored part of the station. \n\nCENTRAL FABRICATION \nThis area houses the Gate’s Schedule 2 printer (Union certification 126 years out of date). There’s always a backlog of at least five to eight days on medium-priority orders, and a month minimum for low. High-priority orders (such as the PCs’ mechs) go through within hours, to the ire of whoever got bumped. What’s left of Jerry’s Sherman Mk. I, the Severance Pay, lies nearby, half-in half-out of the wall and swathed in cables. Its coldcore is currently being used as an auxiliary power source. \n\nMECH BAY \nBetween the aft docking bay and Central Fabrication there’s a large hangar dedicated to the storage and maintenance of the militia’s mechanized chassis, including those belonging to the PCs. Except in emergencies, combat-rated mechs are not permitted anywhere else on the station. AFT HAB RING More comfortable than the forward hab ring, the aft hab ring plays host to most of the station’s operational staff and acts as accommodation for the few guests and tourists the Gate receives. Unless they explicitly desire otherwise, all militia pilots – including the PCs – live here. At the very least, Jerry ensures the station’s defenders live comfortably. \n\nMILITIA MEMORIAL WALL \nA large wall in one of the aft ring’s public plazas has been dedicated as a place of remembrance to all those who died in the defense of Hell’s Gate. Every single militia member killed in action has an individual plaque engraved with their name, and there’s usually a little holo-widget displaying pictures of the deceased as well. Six new names have been added so far this year, all killed by the Hell Hounds. Andros Capella killed two of them himself, and is looking to up those numbers. \n\nDIRECTOR’S OFFICE \nAt one point in time, the Gate’s executive suite was a marvel of orbital decor. Situated in the aft hab ring, it was functional and stylish. It had real wood paneling and leather seats, gold inlay and paintings on the walls; not originals, of course, but high-quality reproductions. Lush houseplants flanked a viewscreen displaying the station. It even had a carpet. The wood was stripped out a century ago. The leather seats deteriorated beyond use. The inlay was recycled for circuitry repairs decades back. The paintings were sold to some casino on the Icebreaker just before Jerry took over, and Jerry has no time to look after plants. All that remains is a desk and endless piles of paperwork. It’s a sad, tired room for a sad, tired man. \n\nBRIEFING ROOM \nA bare chamber with a bunch of folding chairs, a holographic projector and a desk. The lights in here flicker sometimes, but the projector doesn’t, suggesting it’s wired into a better circuit. Jerry briefs the militia in here when their mission requires a more in-depth explanation than “please go shoot these pirates.” Jerry insists this room is a “no snack zone,” a prohibition no member of the militia has ever obeyed. \n\nAFT DOCKING BAY \nThe Gate’s aft docking bay (there’s a nickname for it, not said in polite company) handles the majority of the station’s space traffic, and was intentionally designed as such. The station’s designers imagined a bustling flight deck, with dozens of freighters passing in and out each day. That vision turned out as much of a joke as the bay’s nickname. The team’s personal corvette, the Dragon’s Tooth, is usually stationed here.\n\n\n\nADDITIONAL NPCS \nThis table contains some of the colourful characters the PCs can find around Hell’s Gate on any given day. \n\n1-2 CERULEAN ENCELADUS \nThe galaxy’s eighteenth most popular nu-retro-stasiscore musician. It’s not a very profitable gig, so he’s also the station’s fence. Everyone knows, nobody’s fooled, but Jerry doesn’t take any action because he’s also the only one on the station who can reliably source decent coffee. \n\n3-4 BOSS TEKA ASHENAFI \nThe leader of the Hell’s Gate Miners Union. Ashenafi has issues with Jerry’s management; namely, that a whole lot of the discretionary budget gets spent on the militia (which includes the PCs). He argues – not without merit – that the miners do the only work that generates real revenue for the station, but they don’t see anywhere near enough of the profits. He doesn’t hold a grudge against the PCs, but he’s not exactly friendly, either. \n\n5-6 ZIJAD AL-BASSA \nA technician in the station’s mech bay. Suspected to be a member of HORUS or Horizon, although it’s unclear which. Engages in lengthy philosophical dialogues regarding the sentience of COMP/CON units, often with COMP/CON units – who, curiously enough, always seem to agree with him. \n\n7-8 DR. TUULA VANHATALO \nThe Gate’s chief medical officer and one of its few officially licensed doctors. Perpetually busy. She has several diplomas on her wall, displaying her medical qualifications. Each of them has her picture, but was awarded to a different name, none of which are Tuula Vanhatalo. If she’s ever addressed by any of them, she’ll startle. \n\n9-10 MIKAELA OMNIDOCUMENT-FORMAT \nMikaela is a body-modification enthusiast who’s had a lot of work done. She’s usually browsing new mods on her cool augmented reality interface (you should get one!), and will constantly make recommendations to the PCs, or anyone else who’ll listen. Astute observers will notice that every mod she brings up is produced by an SSC subsidiary not usually available in the Long Rim. Often stands for long periods as if in a trance, seemingly unaware that she’s doing it. \n\n11-12 TARNVEER “PRINTLOAF” MALIK \nA member of the station militia who (on a dare, and against their own better judgement) asked Shelly to give them a callsign. Has resented Shelly ever since. They run a highly profitable side-gig selling stims, mostly to other militia members; they’ve definitely offered to hook the PCs up before. Pilots an IPS-N Lancaster with a muscular, scantily-clad man painted on the side, named Cock-A-Doodle-Doo. \n\n13-14 STEEPLE \nA hydroponics tech with a heavily scarred face and a large Mirrorsmoke Mercenary Company tattoo on his back. Terrible with people, but an absolute virtuoso with plants. Is the only reason anyone on the station ever gets to eat tomatoes. Always seems to be anemic. \n\n15-16 SAMORN PATALUNG \nThe kind, motherly proprietor of Happy Noodle, generally agreed to be the best noodle bar on the station. Most of the station thinks she’s a genius, on account of her ability to make vent crab meat taste of something. It’s an open secret that her establishment is a hangout for local HORUS elements, whom she affectionately calls “the dorks.” \n\n17-18 BARTENDER MOTHERFUCKER \nThe subaltern bartender of GMS_GENERIC_BAR, and the end result of a long series of in-jokes so dense as to be impossible to explain. Mixes an unrivalled Standard-Pattern GMS Margarita. Due to software defects endemic to Calliope COMP/CON units, BARTENDER is indefatigably upbeat and chipper at all times and in all circumstances, even when commiserating or offering condolences. \n\n19-20 ARGUS CHARON \nPLACEHOLDER\n\nDAILY LIFE \nThe station that would one day be named Hell’s Gate was built on dreams of exploiting a vast bounty of mineral wealth, but the market for its wares slowly dwindled to nothing. The company that owned it pulled out a century and a half ago, and for a century and a half it’s been a home for anyone who couldn’t afford to live anywhere else. Life’s hard here, but it’s still life, and it’s life without a high price tag or constant expectations. No matter how cold or unfriendly the directors of Hell’s Gate were, there was always one rule they never broke: nobody on the Gate has to pay to survive. If you’re absolutely flat broke, there’s a warm bunk, printloaf and clean water. Jerry hasn’t been a perfect administrator, but to this day he’s always managed to deliver on this one essential promise, no matter the cost to himself. No Gater can afford to be idle, though. Something’s always going wrong somewhere, and everyone pulls work shifts, even the militia, even members of the Strategic Response Team – and that means the PCs. The most important day-to-day tasks on the station are maintenance, mining and food production, and Jerry has tried his level best to provide them with the funding, materials and equipment they need to do their jobs. The station functions on Cradle Standard Time (or as close to it as possible), with a fourteen-hour day and ten-hour night cycle. Shelly assembles daily work schedules, and works out which tasks need to be assigned to whom. Depending on the task and its required manpower, shifts range from four to twelve hours in length. Shelly tries to ensure nobody works more than twelve hours at once or eighteen hours in a two-day period, but due to the shortage of qualified staff for certain tasks, she can’t always accommodate. The Gate has its own local currency: “ingots.” They’re flexible plastic notes shot through with metal. The value of an ingot depends on which metal is used in their production, and each ingot bears the likeness of the station director who issued their printing. There’s a print for Jerry, but he hasn’t had any made yet. Most petty transactions on the station are done using ingots, given that denominations like “ten-thousandths of a Manna” are difficult to work with. Through longstanding agreement, ingots are legal tender at other settlements in the system, although Impact Dynamics has been given increasingly low exchange rates lately. Anything that isn’t bought is traded for, and there’s a complex system of bartering, trust and favor exchange. It seems bewildering to outsiders, but after a few months of living there, you tend to get a feel for it: you can’t explain why a data storage card is worth three spice packets when it’s a friend asking and five when it’s a stranger, but it feels correct. On their time off, Gaters tend to be innovative and improvisational. Those who can’t afford to take a holiday on the Icebreaker tend to band together to find their own fun: “If you need a place to drink, there’s Aminata’s Saloon and GMS_GENERIC_BAR on the aft, and the fore has On the Rocks and Sol’s Bar and Grille. If you like sports, there’s a gravball court in one of the shuttered refineries, and it’s… mostly safe. “Clubs? Well, it’s nothing like the Icebreaker, but you can go to La Porte De L'Enfer or Never the Two Shall Meet if you want to be miserable. Steer clear of Transgressions unless you’re, uh… into stuff. If you’re not depressed or kinky, your options are sort of limited, but The Dockyard has decent music and the drinks aren’t too overpriced. “There’s video game tournaments every night at Sal’s Slate Shop, so long as the power’s on. If you like music, there’s a makeshift concert hall right next to the dispensary, although the water isn’t always steady there so take a bathroom break first. And if you’re religious, those odd firebird people set up a nondenominational house of worship in that old growhouse in section A3-27.” – Ayanda Delwayo, aeronautics engineer Hell’s Gate also plays host to a unique form of urban exploration: Gaters call it “cubbying.” The station hasn’t matched its original blueprints for decades – it probably didn’t when it was built. So much has been torn down and rebuilt or stolen that there's places and things in the station nobody knows about. On the other side of sealed bulkheads, behind keypads no-one remembers the combination for, through crawlspaces that haven’t been opened for a century, there are secrets waiting to be unearthed. Jerry has officially banned cubbying as a safety hazard, but he can’t really enforce it. In terms of politics, Hell’s Gate leans more towards the Horizon Collective than HORUS. This is in large part because Horizon has an active presence here helping people, but also because HORUS is associated with two of the system’s major pirate groups. The Circuit is openly a HORUS cell, but the Hell Hounds have also received funding from the Cousins, the strongest HORUS presence elsewhere in the Long Rim. Hell’s Gate has a PLACEHOLDER [62] SCENES FROM THE GATE 1-2 A team of stevedores yell in alarm as a cable on a cargo hoist gives way, spilling an entire pallet of crates onto the ground. 3-4 A militia pilot tells stories of their most recent battle against pirates to a couple of folk at a bar. It’s funny, though; you were in that fight, and they’re taking credit for things you or one of your teammates did. 5-6 A customer and the proprietor of a food stall exchange a deafening series of insults, profanities and curses, before cordially agreeing on a price as if nothing happened. They do this every day. 7-8 A pair of wrenchies bicker over different interpretations of the Duality. The guts of the power distributor they’re supposed to be fixing lie strewn around them, forgotten. 9-10 A work crew shuffles into a cafe after a shift, exhausted. The barista already has every single one of their orders ready, and is calling out names as they step in the door without even looking. 11-12 A furloughed mining crew loiters around an intersection, singing an old Long Rim work song. Most of them aren’t great singers individually, but put them together and they can belt. 13-14 A wake is being held for a recently passed resident of the station, and as is tradition, any property they didn’t leave to friends or family is being handed out to strangers. It’s considered rude not to take something. 15-16 A child giggles in delight as they ride around on the shoulders of a subaltern, which halts work every so often to politely request that the child stop climbing on them. 17-18 A timid mech tech shyly explains their job to someone who’s quite clearly attracted to them. Every so often, their timidness falls away as they get really into what they’re talking about, which just makes their companion more interested. 19-20 A hydroponic gardener who’s supposed to be selling her apples is just handing them out to a crowd of grateful children. You notice a wily one sneaking some ingots into her pocket anyway. EQUIPMENT Non-license weapons and systems available to pilots out of Hell’s Gate are often repurposed mining and salvage tools, or entirely novel ad-hoc inventions made to fill a specific niche. The following equipment can be handed out as personal rewards from grateful residents of Hell’s Gate, or by Jerry and Chief McElroy. Bronco Hook Auxiliary Melee, Exotic Gear, AP, Thrown 5 [a1] [1 i] On hit: the Bronco Hook sticks in the target. You may retrieve the Bronco Hook by any means you would retrieve a thrown weapon, and when you do, the target takes 1iAP. If you or the target move away from each other by any means, they take this damage and the Bronco Hook automatically returns to you. On miss: the Bronco Hook automatically returns to you if it was thrown. This appears to be a jury-rigged magnetic accelerator, designed to make tether points on asteroids by driving mech-scale pitons into them. Rule of thumb is if it can pierce a meter of asteroid rock, it can pierce ten centimeters of mech armor. Rebound Pulse Mineral Scanner 1 SP, Exotic Gear, Unique, Quick Tech 1/mission, you may activate this system to SCAN every character in a c7 area, then apply LOCK ON to the character with the most current HP. All hostile characters in the area also lose HIDDEN. A simple piece of tech found on almost every mining ship, modified to provide an effective battlefield reconnaissance tool. Its minimum safe stand-off distance is several hundred kilometers; anything less, and the ping-back is loud enough to blow out the antenna. The Grabber Heavy Melee, Exotic Gear [a2] [2d6i] On hit: you and your target each roll a contested HULL check. If you win the contested roll, your target is knocked PRONE. A standard piece of equipment found on mining and salvage rigs throughout the system; its official product name is the IPS-N Mechanized Chassis Remote Handling Tool, but that’s boring as hell, so most folks call it “the Grabber.” Not much work is needed to repurpose it to grab mechs instead of asteroids. Please note that such modification will void the warranty. [63 ] PILOT GEAR The following equipment represents some of the gear available to spacers and pilots in Calliope. IPS -N “Ahab” Grapple/Tether Line Gear, Limited 3 “You ever get the feeling nobody at IPS -N spends any time thinking about the names they give to things? Like, either I don’t read, so I don’t get the reference, or I do and I realize they named a survival tool after a dude who’s famous exclusively for getting dragged to his death tied to a whale.” You may expend a charge to shoot a hook at a character, object or free space up to b 5 away from you. You are attached to the hook by a tether, and cannot move or be moved further than five spaces away, unless you teleport, in which case the tether snaps. If the hook moves more than five spaces away, you are dragged along with it. As a quick action, you can reel yourself in, flying to the hook or as close to it as possible. This movement ignores engagement and doesn’t provoke reactions. You can detach from the tether as a full action. You can also retrieve a hook and tether that you are adjacent to as a full action, restoring a charge. Scramble Grenade Gear, Limited 1 This is actually a high -power, short -range distress beacon meant to help search -and -rescue teams locate astronauts who’ve been thrown into space. Some asshole discovered that if you jam a bunch of escape characters into the broadcast signal and overvolt the transmitter, you can make unshielded electronics shit themselves. It fries itself after a few seconds, a fate many wrenchies have wished upon its inventor. Expend a charge for the following effect: • Scramble Grenade (Grenade, b5, f 1): Affected characters without the BIOLOGICAL tag must succeed on a SYSTEMS save against 10 + your GRIT or become JAMMED until the end of their next turn.\n\n## COMBAT: A FACE TO A NAME\n\n*What tiny fragments remain of Andros Capella’s chassis drift lazily through the docking bay. All that’s left of the man is a carbon-black scorch mark on the deck plating. It takes you a moment to realize what you’ve done: you’ve killed the leader of one of Calliope’s most notorious pirate gangs. Processing the consequences of that will have to wait, though, as Siren contacts you again. SIREN: “Marines! whatever you just did, the pirates are peeling off, retreating – and we should too! I’m reading a massive thermal build-up in the ship’s drive core!”*\n\n#### FOLLOWING UP \nThe PCs have enough time to return to the Dragon’s Tooth, but give them a sense of urgency. If they want to grab more salvage, loot or intelligence from the Tachyon, make them roll a skill trigger. Emphasize the urgency of the situation; Siren makes increasingly desperate pleas for the PCs to return to the Dragon’s Tooth. Alarms start to sound across the Tachyon; the deck plating starts to rattle and dislodge. If the PCs attempt to override this process and halt the jump, they’ll discover they can’t: an administrative lockout is in effect. Voice authorization from Lead Researcher Jeanette Mkondo and Captain Stefan D’Antillio is required to override the lockout. Jeanette Mkondo can be found in the fabrication room (she’s the floating corpse), but Stefan D’Antillio is not presently aboard the vessel. You barely have time to strap yourself in before Siren sounds the hard-maneuver alarm. “Everybody hold onto your butts!” There’s a tremendous weight on your chest as the engines kick in, pressing you back into the chair. You close your eyes and struggle to breathe. Even with the aid of your hardsuit, you can barely move your fingers. The burn feels like it lasts forever. Grey starts to creep in around the edges of your vision. And then it’s done. It’s over. You’re through. You’re still accelerating at about two gees of thrust, but that’s far more manageable. You’re able to glance around the cabin, check on your fellow team members, look at your ship’s external feeds. There’s a moment of calm. Far behind you, the Tachyon and the Weasel are just a speck, barely visible against the darkness of space. Then there is a silent flash of blinding light. The Tachyon is gone – and with it, its secrets, the Ardent Weasel, and whatever dust remains of Andros Capella. Give the PCs a moment to reflect on all they’ve just witnessed before they start the long journey back to Hell’s Gate.\n\n\n## DOWNTIME 1 - DRINKS ARE ON ME\n\nIt takes another two weeks to return to Hell’s Gate. By then, the news is all over the system: Andros Capella is dead, and the PCs killed him. It doesn’t matter if that’s not what actually happened – the people of Calliope saw the PCs and Andros Capella walk into that ship, and only the PCs walked out. The Hell Hounds have sworn revenge for their slain leader, but rumor has it they’re in serious disarray and in no position to make good on those threats. Getting the printer part to the station relieves an immense amount of pressure, alleviating the many precarious shortages the station was experiencing. Tick a segment on the Station Stability clock. Additionally, if the clock has four or more segments filled, Jerry is able to set aside a little something as thanks for the players. The PCs gain Jerry’s Care Package, which they can use later, in Chapter 2. Jerry’s Care Package Favors, Limited 2 A bunch of Icebreaker currency, a few backstage passes, a case of Elysian champagne, a scrawled note containing the passphrases to several of the “niche interest” clubs and VIP tickets to the next championship mech bout. Kick your feet up and relax. You deserve it! Expend a charge when you’re on the Icebreaker and not in immediate danger. You can take a Downtime Action appropriate to the situation, right now. Regardless, the players are able to undertake a FULL REPAIR now that the printer is running again, and with a moment to breathe, they can take a downtime action. At some point, Jerry signs some requisition forms and the PCs advance to LICENSE LEVEL 1. Run a few vignettes to explain how they get their new gear. Encourage the PCs to spend time around Hell’s Gate, building on relationships they developed over the course of the chapter. The Gate, now in much better repair and under far less strain on its resources, is fully open to them. Given the tenuous situation with the pirates, however, Jerry still won’t authorize unescorted trips off the station. If the PCs need reserves, there’s places on Hell’s Gate they might get them. Jerry, Chief McElroy or Zinfandel aren’t exactly flush with spare supplies, but they’d certainly be willing to do a few favors for the people who saved the station. The Horizon Collective has a subaltern clinic on the aft hab ring, and they always seem to be well-stocked. There’s a thriving grey market among the militia, and there’s always traders in port who might have something you’re looking for. If nothing else, you can always go trawling through the junk-yards and trash-heaps – it’s not dignified or hygienic, but even in space, people throw an awful lot of useful stuff away. \n\n### HELL’S GATE DOWNTIME ACTIVITIES \nHere are some downtime actions specific to Hell’s Gate that the PCs can undertake now, or whenever they have downtime on the station. You can also create your own using these or the ones in Lancer or The Long Rim as starting points. \n\n\n\n\n\n# END OF CHAPTER 1","lastmodified":"2022-11-13T05:12:45.176359505Z","tags":null},"/GM/Plotting/Space-and-Size":{"title":"","content":"A sailed trip from London to Sydney was roughly 13000 miles (not as the crow files) and the sailed trip from London to America was 3000 miles.

Play ACT 1 of IN GOLDEN FLAME for LANCER THE TABLETOP RPG\n2.  Have the players understand that we will be alternating to another setting in order to prevent entering a rut and allow the return to ACT 2 of IN GOLDEN FLAME to be exciting.\n3.

Return to IN GOLDEN FLAME\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# FROM ADVENTURE PATH\nTaken straight from the ACT 1 Prerelease Draft\n\nAct 1 covers Tier 1 play from LL 0-5. It introduces players and their characters to the mechanics of Lancer, the setting of Calliope and the story’s primary antagonists, the Cult of the One. It culminates in a battle that hints at the full extent of the Cult’s capabilities and ambitions.\n\nAct 2 will cover Tier 2 play from LL 5-9. Stones are thrown into Calliope’s pond as several new factions arrive, each presenting their own opportunities and dangers to the system’s residents. While the team contend with these newcomers, they must also recruit allies and strengthen Calliope against the rapidly encroaching Cult. These preparations will be put to the test during a climactic assault on their home\n\nAct 3 will cover Tier 3 play from LL9-12. This is the endgame. The Cult is now in open war with the rest of the system as it rushes to achieve its final, apocalyptic vision. Lives hang in the balance, and the player characters must pit their war machines against the servants of an awakening god.","lastmodified":"2022-11-13T05:12:45.176359505Z","tags":null},"/Improvisation":{"title":"","content":"Printers are expensive in both energy and materials, and the ones in Calliope are outdated, inefficient and constantly backlogged. The system’s manufacturing base is piecemeal and scattershot, with part shortages plaguing every industrial sector. In this climate, the ability to reuse existing materials or invent workarounds has become a distinct cultural virtue. Calliope’s early orbital habitats were ad hoc constructions, built by necessity with equipment and components not designed for the purpose. Once the Calliope Project knew what it was working with, prefab station kits were sent and deployed, but as the Pyrite Age drew to a close, the system’s citizens were once again forced to improvise. What was lying around had to be sufficient – there was nothing else to use. This emphasis on improvisation can be felt in every aspect of Calliope’s culture, from obvious things like the construction of stations and mechs to areas like music, art and food. Calliopean cuisine is adaptive; it has to be. You can’t stake a business on selling tomato soup every day, because tomorrow there might not be any tomatoes left. Food stands change their menus daily because people need to be fed, and they can only cook what’s available. If vent crab meat is all there is, you need to cook it, with enough nutrition that people stay healthy and enough flavor that people can force it down. Calliopean chefs can often seem like miracle workers given what they have to work with. Nu-retro-stasiscore is a music genre that samples the bland, generic, soothing music played on sleeper ships just after you wake up from stasis, then chops and remixes it into a sort of nostalgic, vibe-heavy chillout track, often with rapped vocals. One pastime is “sigdiving” – a mixture of signal analysis and hacking. Systems across the Long Rim, Calliope in particular, are full of forgotten satellites, server farms, broadcast towers, wrecks, beacons and other junk that still has active transceivers. Old transmissions are still bouncing around, picked up and rebroadcast by a vast array of repeater stations, from first-generation distress calls to the decaying comm chatter of Armory-Barony fleet battles or Pyrite Age advertisements. There’s valuable data out there, beneath terabytes of garbage. Sigdivers search for it, sifting through the noise like digital salvage crews. With knowledge of what to look for and how to look for it, you can pull blueprints, passcodes, military intelligence or even paracode out of the wavelengths. Even the less juicy stuff is still worth something; Calliope’s music scene will pay a lot for genuine recovered audio samples. A slim majority of Calliope’s sigdivers are Horizon affiliates, but HORUS claims almost as many.","lastmodified":"2022-11-13T05:12:45.176359505Z","tags":null},"/Language":{"title":"","content":"Calliope has no official language, but they do have a system-local dialect of Union Common. It’s spoken faster than baseline UC, with fewer conjunctions, simplified pronunciation and a vast array of loan words from other languages. Those used to another dialect of UC might need a little bit of time to get used to it, but it’s meant to be easy to pick up. There’s no “standard” accent, but most people will be able to tell where you live by how you pronounce “Calliope.” Calliopean sign language is based loosely on Union Common sign language, and is signed one-handed. Most adults know enough to hold a conversation, although maintenance personnel learn it fully, in order to facilitate communication in very loud or completely soundless environments.","lastmodified":"2022-11-13T05:12:45.176359505Z","tags":null},"/Names-and-Identity":{"title":"","content":"To outsiders, the way people in Calliope treat names can seem whimsical or frivolous. They see people with names like Igama Igama Igama, Apricot Grinder or Priyanashi Chant-Cast, and assume Calliopeans don’t take names seriously. Calliopeans would reply that no, it’s the other way round: outsiders take names too seriously. They give them a power and a weight that isn’t due to them. A name is simply how an individual chooses to be referred to. If someone tells you their name’s Igama Igama Igama, and they’re happy for you to call them that, that’s all you need to know. Were they born with it? Probably not, but what business is it of yours? \n\nIn the Far Plane's wild frontier, there’s few legal documents. In fact, many of its inhabitants came out here specifically to escape what their legal documents say about them. It’s polite not to dig too deeply into someone’s past – and if you’re here, there’s a good chance you want that same privacy. A time-honored Calliope tradition is the “line of sight” name. There’s a common story to this: someone comes to the Far Plane, gets asked their name, decides they have to make one up and then picks something on the spot based on what they can see, which explains names like Apricot Grinder or Zinfandel DeJean. It’s not always as sudden, though: some people pick things they see often, or that have emotional meaning to them. A similar option is to pick a name related to your job. “Chosen,” “Farmer,” “Weaver,” “Fixer,” “Ruin,” “Line” and so on are common elements of Calliopean names. Other people pick new names from their home culture, or a culture that they greatly admire. There’s an in-joke: if you want to find a Hob in Calliope, look for someone with a Elf name. Some people feel no need to hide, and keep their old name, but it doesn’t make any difference. Your name is how you choose to be known, nothing more. Children born in Calliope are given a birth name by their parents, but one of the system’s coming-of-age rituals is picking your own name. A person keeping their childhood name into adulthood is a sign of immaturity, so it’s common to see young people who haven’t decided yet going by the name “Temporary.” Calliopeans apply the same concept to identity in general. While social bonds are very important, they pay very little heed to the circumstances of one’s birth.","lastmodified":"2022-11-13T05:12:45.176359505Z","tags":null},"/Politics":{"title":"","content":"There is no nation in Calliope, no recognized central authority that handles security, commerce or social needs. Union, despite claiming all of life as its purview, does not recognize Calliope as a member region on a practical level. That doesn’t mean Calliope has no politics, though. Politics in Calliope are complex, omnipresent and often brutal. Trade guilds are in a constant struggle with merchants, barons and marauders. City magistrates have to contend with pirates seeking protection money, or out-of-town traders who think they can get one over on a yokel. \n\n\n#scrape\nAs for Union’s political coalitions, the New Solidarity Coalition is heavily invested in Calliope. In fact, Calliope is one of the NSC’s most popular examples of Union’s shortcomings in the fight for human dignity. For its more activist members, this means travelling out and helping the desperate. Unfortunately, there are also no shortage of armchair pundits content to talk about it in their omnicasts from the comfort of a core world, fundraise for their own causes and do little else. The Horizon Collective has a strong presence in the system too, both in collaboration with the NSC and on their own initiative. They differ from the NSC mostly in that Calliopeans see the NSC as a group of sometimeshelpful outsiders, while local members of Horizon tend to be seen as Calliopeans who just “have a thing.” The Verdant Social Arc maintains a modest outreach, but in truth it has more important things to worry about than some backwater that doesn’t even vote in Union elections. The Interstellar, Fourth Column and New Humanity Front are nonentities in Calliope, each considering it irrelevant for their own reasons.","lastmodified":"2022-11-13T05:12:45.176359505Z","tags":null},"/Sessions/2022-11-06-Session-3":{"title":"","content":"# CHAPTER 1 Cont.\n\n*What tiny fragments remain of [[Andros Capella]]’s chassis drift lazily through the docking bay.

[[Characters/Hells Gate/Jerry Masters]], [[Characters/Hells Gate/Chief McElroy]] or [[Characters/Hells Gate/Zinfandel DeJean]] aren’t exactly flush with spare supplies, but they’d certainly be willing to do a few favors for the people who saved the city. \nThe [[Horizon Collective]] has a subterrainian clinic on the aft-side,  and they always seem to be well-stocked. \nThere’s a thriving grey market among the militia, and there’s always traders in port who might have something you’re looking for. \nIf nothing else, you can always go trawling through the scrap-yards and trash-heaps – it’s not dignified or hygienic, but even in space, people throw an awful lot of useful stuff away. \n\n## END OF CHAPTER 1\n\n# CHAPTER 2 \"ICE AND FIRE\"\n\nA couple of weeks to a month after the PCs return from the Tachyon, Jerry calls them into the briefing room again. Unusually, he asks them to clean up, dress formally and be on their best behaviour for this meeting. When you enter the room, you notice you and Jerry aren’t its only occupants – sort of. The vidscreen displays the flickering image of a severe woman in a crisp white suit. As you arrive, she narrows her eyes. Jerry adjusts his collar nervously. “So, uh, in case you don’t know, this is Rita, station director on the Icebreaker Borealis. My counterpart!” When she speaks, it’s in a cool, level tone. “Good morning. I’ve heard a lot about you from Jerry and from system gossip. Word is we have you to thank for Andros Capella exiting the stage. Good work! I’m glad Hell’s Gate is finally cleaning up its messes.” Jerry looks upset by this statement, but Rita cuts him off before he can speak. “Let’s get down to business. Jerry says that since you sent the Hell Hounds packing, salvage and mining crews have been able to get to work properly for the first time in months. “Well, you’re in luck. The Icebreaker is undertaking some major expansion projects this quarter, and I’m willing to offer guaranteed, above-market prices for anything you’re selling; raw materials, construction equipment, salvage, whatever. I’ll even comp you and your freighter crews for a few nights on the town. I have one condition.” Jerry takes a deep breath. “You always do, Rita.” Rita shoots a withering glare at Jerry, before continuing. “I want to subcontract your team. I have a very sensitive job that needs a competent crew. You fit the profile, and critically, you’re not working for anyone on the Board.” Rita isn’t the most patient soul in the world, but she does understand the team will probably have a lot of questions, so she politely answers them. \n\n### WHY US? \n“Like I said, you’re competent, you’re available, you’re reliable – or so Jerry tells me, at least. But most importantly, you’re not under the thumb of anyone on the Board. That aspect, in fact, is perhaps your most important quality: it means that I can convince the Board to pay you.” She rubs the bridge of her nose irritably. “The Board are a gaggle of paranoid, squabbling toddlers. When anything – and I do mean anything – goes wrong with anyone’s business, they immediately suspect a plot by one of their rivals. And let me clarify: everyone – and I do mean everyone – on the Board are rivals. “They’d never authorise me to hire any member’s private security team for this job, and I can’t trust anyone in the station’s mutual defence force either. I need a small, competent team from outside the Icebreaker’s usual sphere. You killed Andros Capella, and beheaded one of the system’s most dangerous pirate groups. Put simply: you qualify.” \n\n### THE JOB \n“I’m going to have to ask you to wait until you arrive on the Icebreaker for specific briefings, but in general terms: I suspect a plot against the Board from an external force. Odd things have been happening recently, both on the station and in our orbital neighbourhood. Power fluctuations, system intrusions, missing persons, traffic irregularities. “Everyone on the Board thinks it’s someone else on the Board, and yes, it’s true they’re always plotting against each other. But this feels different, in a way I can’t quite quantify. Things are happening that wouldn’t benefit anyone in the station’s current order. Customers are discontent. There’s grumbling from residents. Seasonal workers are getting spooked. “No, everyone’s losing money on this. I need you to look into this matter, and put a stop to it. I’m willing to pay top ice to see it done.” \n\n### THE PAY \n“Well, as I previously mentioned, I’ll offer guaranteed prices on everything your station is willing to sell to us. I know the Gate is always in need of cash. “I’ll also open a budget for reasonable expenses. As long as you don’t abuse my generosity too much, you and your freighter crews don’t have to spend a single icicle of your own during your stay. I don’t want anyone – the culprits included – to suspect I’ve brought in outside investigators, so I want you to be seen around the station, spending money like everyone else. It just won’t be your money. “Lastly, I happen to have better contacts than Jerry does, and if you need more powerful hardware, I can hook you up – once I start seeing results, of course.” \n\nJERRY’S OPINION Jerry scratches his head self-consciously. “My? Opinion? Oh, right. I mean… killing Andros Capella kicked the Hell Hounds real good. They’re making, uh, they’re making all sorts of threats that they’re in no state to carry out. The Gate’ll be, it’ll be fine until you get back. The militia’s got this locked down. “But we could really use money. And… well, the Icebreaker is one of our biggest customers. And they’re offering guaranteed prices on our goods. That’s… that’s pretty good, guys? Plus, plus, Rita knows some people. She can hook you up with mech stuff we just don’t have the budget for. “She can be…” Jerry pauses for a moment, as Rita’s glare sharpens to a razor point. “… cold, sometimes. But you can trust her implicitly.” You see just a split second of emotion pass across Rita’s face, before the stoic mask reasserts itself. \n\n\n## PRIOR TO DEPARTURE \nThe PCs have a little time to spend on Hell’s Gate before they leave. Since they’re about to spend a whole mission away on the Icebreaker, this is a good chance for them to engage with some of the Gate’s NPCs. Here are some suggestions for things that might be going on around the Gate right now: \n• Jerry’s stressed, which isn’t unusual, but it seems to be specifically related to Rita. If pressed on the issue, he admits that he used to be involved with her. But then he became station director, and a relationship between two station directors was never going to end well. \n• Chief McElroy is watching every single print job like an angry hawk. She says her vigilance is critical to prevent a repeat of the accident that nearly crippled the station. The print team say it’s only preventing an end to the backlog the accident caused. \n• Zinfandel is a little concerned about the threats the Hell Hounds have been making, and is stepping up patrols of Stygia’s orbital neighborhood. \n• Printloaf wants to expand their selection of stims, which is running a little thin. The Dragon’s Tooth won’t be subject to the same customs checks that other ships are, which means it’d be easier to run product back from the Icebreaker. Printloaf’s willing to cut the team in on the profits if they help; ten percent is fair, right? \n• Samorn Patalung mentions there’s a Horizon Collective repair shop on the Icebreaker. The HORUS dorks who hang out at her stand have talked about wanting to knock it over for a while – go and warn them, maybe? \n• Striga Von Aldenberg is inconsolable with worry over the PCs’ safety, insisting that the Icebreaker is “a wretched den of schemes, intrigue and skullduggery.” She’s very coherent today, actually; all the plots and conspiracies that she’s describing are well-evidenced and verifiable. It’s kind of unsettling. Then she goes off about how a secret apocalypse cult has started operating there, and it’s back to business as usual. \n• Boss Teka Ashenafi accosts a PC – one who he’s on decent terms with, hopefully – and starts asking pointed questions about mining contracts. He’s heard some rumors on the grapevine about a big job in the system, and he wants to make sure Jerry is putting a bid in for it. \n\nGive a general impression of how Hell’s Gate is faring at the moment, depending on the status of the Station Stability clock. If it only has a couple of segments ticked, things won’t look great: flickering lights, queues for essential supplies, jury-rigged fixes due to parts shortages, grime and an overall air of melancholy. This isn’t anything new, incidentally; this is just how life on Hell’s Gate usually is. On the other hand, if the clock is at three or four segments, the PCs have been putting in the work, and it’s starting to show. Things look a little cleaner and a little brighter. There’s the parts and the time to make proper repairs. Shortages are easing and people can afford little luxuries. Citizens’ lives are better because of what the PCs did – make sure they know that.\n\nThe journey from Hell’s Gate to the Icebreaker Borealis takes about eleven days. The PCs travel in the Dragon’s Tooth, as one of the escorts for the convoy of freighters hauling metal ingots, polycrete and salvage. Their trip is comfortable and uneventful.\n\n*As the cloudy, sand-yellow sphere of Kalevala and its majestic ring system grows in your vision, a small, bright dot grows with it, perched high in orbit. Within hours, that dot resolves into a vast, tangled cylinder of habitats anchored to the remains of an immense mining frigate. The station spills bright neon light into the void, and local space is a hive of activity, dozens of ships arriving and leaving at this very moment. The Icebreaker’s main port works just fine, and docking is a quick and painless process. The fun doesn’t start until you take an elevator down the struts into the Sprawl. In the Grand Concourse that marks the start of the Starstrip, a man is waiting for you – one of the greeters. He explains your hotel reservations, recommends several of the station’s attractions, ensures that you receive all your complimentary gift vouchers, and then very quietly informs you that a meeting has been scheduled for you at lunch tomorrow, in the backroom of the Uncrowned King bar and grille. Until then, you’re told to blend in and enjoy yourselves.*\n\n### RADIO GAGA\nAt some point, have this play over the radio to a player\n*“Well, listeners, we’ve had one hell of a show, and I’ll leave you with this thought. Been over two months since the devil Andros Capella vanished in a slip, but don’t it feel like the after-image barely left our eyes? When you shut them, can’t you still see it? That rift, flicking there and then not before your retinas?\n“Seems nobody can get Capella’s dyin’ out of their sight. Whole region’s been awash in the names of the chosen who killed him – and the way I hear it, over both raised drinks and sharpened knives. What must it be like to be the chosen who killed the Hound of Hell? To most, you’re a hero, scratchin’ out a threat to Calliope’s spacelanes. To others, you’re an enemy, a threat who needs scratchin’ out yourself. But perhaps most unsettlin’ of all, listeners, imagine this: to a very few people you’re somethin’ else entirely: a curiosity. Somethin’ that warrants further examination – and that examination could be the ‘friendly chat’ kind, or it could be the ‘insect under glass’ kind. “If you’re out there, Chosen, if you’re listenin’? Stay safe. Seems like you’re the main characters of Calliope today. “This is Irvin Reid for Icebreaker Public Radio, tellin’ you to… stay cool out there.”*\n\n\n## BEAT 2 - A CONTRACT THRILLER\nThe PCs have a whole afternoon, evening and morning to themselves. They may each take one DOWNTIME ACTION, as long as it would fit in that timescale. There’s time for a few hours at a casino, a night out drinking, or a morning of networking and seeking out contacts. When the PCs have finished whatever they’re doing before the meeting, Rita is waiting for them at the Uncrowned King. \n\n*Rita takes a deep breath. “Alright. I’ve got a lot of things to get through, so listen closely. The situation’s developed since I first called you in, and not in a good way, either.\"\n“Firstly. Two weeks ago, Serendipitous Vitamin, a census officer and a member of my Civic Management bureau, was murdered in his home by a single shot to the back of the head. No signs of struggle or forced entry. Later that evening, his office was ransacked. “The very next morning, just before I called you in, one of Civic Management’s data-centers was raided by a small paramilitary group who we’ve been unable to identify. They took the staff hostage, but no-one was hurt, thank the Buddha. They deleted every record they could get their hands on, trashed the place and then vanished. It was in the middle of a backup cycle, so we’ve lost a week’s worth of data, including the off-site copy of Vitamin’s notes. “Secondly, someone forged my credentials, and wrote a false work order to have repair work done on the Borealis’ main reactor array. They got some… charitable religious group, the Faith of the One Plumed in Golden Flame? Well, they did the repairs. “Then, somehow, Fayad Harb, the boss of the engineer’s union, got word of all of this. Now he’s furious at me because he thinks I used non-union labor, and the entire tech union are on strike. “As if all that wasn’t bad enough, Harrison Armory’s on my case about some missing scientist of theirs. They hold me personally responsible for finding her – as if I’m supposed to keep tabs on two million people visiting my station at any given moment! “Add to that the printers have been going haywire for weeks, there’s power fluctuations, pop-up protests… I’m positive. Someone is fucking with my station. I want them found, and I want them stopped. “Just one issue: the Board hasn’t authorized this operation. They don’t even know about it. I can persuade them to grant ex-post-facto legitimacy once you deliver results, but nobody on the board will sign off on activating you right now. There’s too little trust. In short: stick to investigation until you have a solid lead, and confine your efforts to the Sprawl. I retain the final word on whether or not you deploy mechs. Keep that in your mind at all times. “I’m currently holding your mechs in storage. When you need them, here is a secure contact channel. I’ll need a good justification for the deployment of military hardware on my station before I release them. Understood?”* \n\nRita is happy to provide more detail on any of these topics if the PCs enquire. \nAt some point in the conversation, Rita is rudely interrupted. It happens quite suddenly: every screen in the room goes blank for a moment, and then displays an emergency alert. Sirens start sounding. Surprisingly, Rita doesn’t panic. Instead, she just groans loudly and buries her head in her hands. After a few seconds, the sirens stop, and everything goes back to normal. *“Oh, me cago en diez! They promised me they’d fixed that. No, don’t get up, don’t get up. That’s another thing I was meaning to mention. Every single day, at the exact same time, the station’s general alarm goes off. If all of this other shit wasn’t going on, I’d think it was someone’s sick idea of a joke.”* \n\n##### SERENDIPITOUS VITAMIN’S MURDER \n“I mean, it could have just been a crime of passion, but I don’t buy it. It was premeditated, quiet and professional. He was on to something, and somebody killed him to cover it up. If you need more information, talk to Officer Lamariano.” \n\n##### DATACENTRE ATTACK \n“Well, it was probably to destroy Serendipitous Vitamin’s notes before they made it onto an off-site backup. There’s a hostile strike team operating on my station and we can’t keep track of them. I want you to make finding them and shutting them down a priority. Officer Narangerel is head of that investigation. Talk to her.” \n\n##### FORGED CREDENTIALS AND REACTOR REPAIRS \n“Let me worry about the forged credentials. What I want you looking into is why someone wanted the reactors repaired. If this was just a charity case, why would they need to fake a work order from me to get them online again? No, nobody does that sort of thing if they have an altruistic motive. “The best people to talk to about this would be members of the tech union. Unfortunately, a whole lot of them are strike right now. I guess you could also talk to the Faith of the One, since they did the repairs. They insist they were just following the work order they got given. Not sure if I trust them, though.”\n\n##### FAYAD HARB’S STRIKE \n“I can’t get through to Fayad. And it hurts! He’s one of my closest allies on the Board. He thinks I snubbed him by using non-union labour. Now the [100] engineer’s union is striking, and they’re only responding to emergency callouts. Work is piling up, and visitors are starting to complain. Maybe you’ll have better luck talking to him. “It’s not exactly as if he’ll be hard to find. He’s still protesting right outside my office.” \n\n##### MISSING HARRISON ARMORY SPECIALIST \n“Dr. Genevieve Nyambose. She went missing just a day after you left Hell’s Gate. Some specialist researcher or something. The Armory’s threatening legal proceedings against the Board if I don’t get her back. They won’t win, but that’s not the problem: they’re also threatening a boycott, and they’re one of our largest visitor demographics. “If you want to try talking to them, you can speak to Sergeant Hemmingsen. Don’t expect a warm welcome.”\n\n##### LACK OF BOARD AUTHORISATION \n“If I suggested hiring external contractors, each member of the Board would instantly work it into one of their grand conspiracy theories. They’d think I’d lost my neutrality, that I’m plotting with one of them against the rest. So I had to take unilateral action without their approval. “You have to understand my position. The Board is a gaggle of psychotic toddlers, and they all have guns and lawyers. I have to be the one adult in the room, and like any spoilt child, they resent me for it. Every day I wake up and spend dawn ‘til dusk trying to save these puerile dipshits from themselves, often against their will, so they don’t tear this station apart or accidentally dump us into Kalevala’s atmosphere. “Painfully often, I have to justify my actions after the fact, when I don’t have weeks or months to play kindergarten teacher. This is one of those times. I need you to save this station before they know you’re trying to help them, because once they do, they won’t let you.” \n\n##### FALSE ALARMS \n“Every day. Every single day, for the past couple of weeks, at least. I’m this close to just disconnecting the emergency alert system until they can fix it, safety be damned.”\n\n## BEAT ","lastmodified":"2022-11-13T05:12:45.180359566Z","tags":null},"/Shared-Struggle":{"title":"","content":"A common theme of Calliopean culture is the idea that all are part of a part of a shared struggle. \n\nThere’s a saying: “the richest ass in Calliope sits a day further from death.” Money can’t patch a splintered hull, grow a bundle of rice or run new ley lines; only people can do that. \n\nCalliopean philosophy is clear: you need people, and people need you, whether or not you admit it. Calliopeans tend to be multi-talented, with every adult and most children knowing basic runecraft and medicine. Common wisdom says anyone who’s sixteen years old should be able to \n\npatch an air leak, swap a water filter and treat acute radiation sickness. \n\nMost people in a city work shifts in maintenance teams from time to time, mostly on simple tasks like cleaning, rune replacement and local patch jobs.

Outside of keeping a city and its people safe from the unnatural world, Calliopeans occupy their free time with pursuits that can hold their attention and contribute something to their community: music, art, writing, storytelling, cooking, enchanting. Anything’s good, so long as it can bring others joy as well. Either your hobby or your profession should give back to the community; and ideally, both. This theme pervades Calliope’s cultural output: a lot of its songs and stories aren’t about a person, but people; people in a tough situation, working together and helping each other.

It consists of two texts, The Tyrant Upon the Mountain and The Saint Upon the Mountain, two stories that appear to be at once the same and very different. They revolve around a character who bears no name other than “the Tyrant” or “the Saint,” respectively. The world in which the character lives is ruined by the greed, corruption and selfishness of the rich and powerful. The character possesses “a great power,” the nature of which is not elaborated upon except to note that “neither science nor faith” could explain it. The stories diverge at this point, with the Tyrant using their power to wage an unrestrained war of revenge against their oppressors, heedless of collateral damage. Meanwhile, the Saint uses their power to protect the marginalized and uplift victims of injustice. The stories converge again after each character’s respective victory. Both characters withdraw to seclusion atop a mountain, with the Tyrant leaving only to punish disobedience and the Saint never leaving at all. A commoner comes to the mountain to ask a question of the character, with both question and answer varying depending on which text is read. The commoner asks the Tyrant why, coming from a world of suffering and pain, they didn’t use their great power to heal it, instead of brutalizing it further. The Tyrant answers that they cannot trust the world to be a better place – it had the opportunity to change for itself, and it didn’t. The only world the Tyrant can imagine is a world that bows down before someone, and that someone might as well be the Tyrant. The commoner asks the Saint why, with all the good they’ve done for the world, they don’t participate in it. The Saint answers that they saw what concentrated power is capable of; it created the society they fought against. If they once again immersed themselves in the world, they fear they would feel too great a temptation to control it, under the pretext of ensuring mistakes were not made. At some point, the Saint insists, they must trust in others. Both stories end with the commoner leaving the mountain changed, the implication being that either the Tyrant or that Saint’s power has transferred to them. Where exactly the Duality comes from is a subject of massive scholarly debate. It recurs in so many distinct and physically distant cultures that its origin must be pre-Fall, but there’s no text in the Massif Vaults that closely matches it. Efforts to find or reconstruct an original version have failed. [33 ] A popular fringe theory is that it’s a “convergent meme,” an idea so fundamental that many societies will develop it independently over a long enough timescale. This isn’t as strange as it sounds; after all, the stories develop it independently over a long enough timescale. This isn’t as strange as it sounds; after all, the stories discuss fairly common human experiences. The Tyrant is a story about abuse creating abusers. The Saint is a story about planting trees whose shade you’ll never sit in. Both are stories about the fear of power changing the people who wield it. The Duality has also been derided by critics as “one of the most damaging concepts in academic philosophy,” given that it suggests that the only two paths for a revolutionary once the revolution is over are “turning into something worse” or “turning into an embittered loner.” It’s often used as a straw man for arguments against dualism in general. Another observation about the Duality is that the protagonists of both stories are obviously the same person. What appears to be two stories is, in fact, just one with two interpretations. What’s curious is that this appears to have been intentional; both parts of the Duality appear to have been the work of a single author. In the Long Rim, there’s a popular identification with the commoner: an often -overlooked character with little agency, whose only notable act is to ask a powerful entity why they’re not helping. There’s a strong association of the Saint with Union, but in an unkind way: as a weak character who could do a lot more to help if they weren’t so terrified of their own power. The Tyrant is the water barons, the pirate bands, the landlords: people stuck in the same hellscape as everyone else, using what power they have to make things even worse. In Calliope, the Duality is many things. Conmen sell ancient -looking “original texts” to the gullible. Maggies debate it to pass the time on repair jobs. Warlocks attempt to place public figures into either “Tyrant” or “Saint” categories (the weekly “why Jerry Masters is the Tyrant” meeting was forcible disbanded after 12,239 hours of furious debate).","lastmodified":"2022-11-13T05:12:45.180359566Z","tags":null},"/The-Factions-of-Calliope":{"title":"","content":"Equally far from the grand bastion of Union and the shining frontier of the Dawnline Shore, but the political situation in Calliope is no less complex for its isolation.

Calliope is a hostile place, even if not all of it is human hostility. Some people talk about the void as a malevolent thing, but whether or not you believe that, space will kill you. Even without pirates, debt collectors and black ops teams, you’re in a fight to survive every day of your life. Even the human violence isn’t always direct. Charging a price for a glass of water that someone can’t afford kills them as surely as a bullet. Forcing someone to live in squalor when you could provide them with a clean place to rest is violence, even if you aren’t beating them. Burying someone in debt isn’t violence? Find a man going grey before his time from the stress of paying his bills, and say that to his face. There’s a lot of overt human violence too. The pirates have a rule about not preying on permanent residents of Calliope, but that’s inconsistently enforced. Visitors are the juiciest targets; after all, they’re the ones bringing fresh money and goods into the system. But when there’s not many visitors, and a payment is due, any mark will do – even a fellow resident. It doesn’t end there, though. Every so often, a visitor who gets ripped off in Calliope looks to take revenge, or comes to the system looking for someone who’s hiding there. If they’re really serious about it, they bring in their own paramilitary forces. If they don’t know precisely who they’re looking for or where they’re hiding, and don’t approach their task with due care and restraint, things can get ugly real quick. Calliopeans have developed an etiquette to open violence; in fact, possibly the only true test of whether a person is “from” Calliope is whether they follow it. Calliopeans accept that violence happens, and people will get ripped off, hurt, even killed, but they have a right to fight for themselves. It goes something like this: only fight if you need to. Don’t kill unless you need to. If you need to kill someone, don’t trick them into thinking surrender is an option, and if surrender is an option, make sure everyone knows it. Given that they live in such a violent place, the residents of Calliope have also developed a lot of ways of regaining a sense of control over violence. Extreme sports are popular in the system, and no-holds-barred mech combat is one of the least exotic. From cloudskipping in the upper atmospheres of gas giants to rocket-sledding on Asphodel, Calliopeans have an endless variety of ways to voluntarily expose themselves to peril – because then, at least, the risk of death is their choice.","lastmodified":"2022-11-13T05:12:45.180359566Z","tags":null}}
