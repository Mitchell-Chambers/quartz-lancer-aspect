Most days, she’s neck-deep in the business of managing the wrenchies and ensuring Hell’s Gate still has air, water and lights. Never one to shy away from hard work, she leads from the front, usually being the first to clock in for shifts and the last to clock out. In truth, she would’ve been a better choice than Jerry to replace Director Bai, and everyone knows it. But everyone also knew that removing her from her current post would be a disaster. Nobody knows their way around the Gate like she does, and losing her handson expertise wasn’t something the station could afford. Despite the pressure placed upon her by her towering work schedule, she’s usually level-headed and rarely loses her cool. Since the recent debacle with the printer, however, she’s become sterner, punishing breaches of maintenance protocol she previously let slide. She’s also made a dire “promise” that, should the printer ever work again, anyone who submits a fabrication without triple-checking it first “will wanna get good at spacewalking real quick.” \n\n## HISTORY WITH PLAYERS\n\n\n## RELATIONSHIPS\n\n\n## SECRETS EARNED\n\n\n## VIBES\n*\"Anyone who submits a weave without triple-checking it first will want to get really immune to breathing mana.\"*^quote\n\n# Tags\n#Female #HellsGate #Halfling","lastmodified":"2022-11-06T04:54:24.012479617Z","tags":null},"/Characters/Hells-Gate/Ipswitch-Delacey":{"title":"","content":"# IPSWITCH \"SWITCH\" DELACEY\n#### ILLUSIONIST SENSATION\n##### GNOME MALE\nThin and pale, with their hair bleached platinum white, Ipswich “Switch” DeLacey is a loud, extroverted bundle of energy. They appeared on the station a few years ago, and promptly took up the career of “lifestyle Omninet streamer.” Since then, Switch and their fleet of camera drones have become a common sight. The fact that they’re often broadcasting live footage of the station’s inner workings and day-to-day events poses a minor security issue for Jerry. It’s likely he’d have shut the whole racket down a while back, were Ipswich not putting half of their stream’s donation money into the station’s discretionary budget. They’re a member of and point of contact for the Horizon Collective – although this seems to be a fact that Ipswich just decided was true, and Horizon grudgingly had to accept. Nonetheless, Ipswich does have a few useful acquaintances in the organization they can put people in touch with. If the PCs seem interesting or cool, Ipswich will try to spend time with them, interview them, or even ride along with them on a mission if one of them has an expanded compartment. Jerry will refuse to authorize this, but there’s little he can actually do to stop the PCs if they take Switch up on this.

She excelled in the role, and continues to fill it to this day, ferrying the Strategic Response Team between jobs. As a military asset under SecComm, she cultivated the stern, impatient attitude of a drill sergeant, but in the present era, with the novel experience of being treated as a person instead of a weapon, she demonstrates a more level-headed, outgoing attitude. She has a habit of flipping between these expressions suddenly, often while under stress. She also calls the team “marines,” no matter how many times they ask her to stop. Her casket has eleven tally marks on its casing, but she doesn’t know what they mean.

Your cabin is cramped like a prison cell, three and a half meters long, two meters wide and two meters tall, and it has to cram a bunk, a desk, storage bins, a personal console, a shower-toilet cubicle and your hardsuit locker into that space. You know what, scratch that prison cell thing – not even the cruelest brig designer would make a hole this cramped. But keep your perspective here: as far as this station goes, you live in luxury. You have all this space to yourself, your own shower and your own toilet. Most people in the Gate are living two to a room, and they all have to share the facilities with three other cabins. Thank goodness you know how to pilot a mech, right? That’s what gets you a whole seven square meters to call your own. You grope in the darkness for the light switch, and it flickers. Once, twice, three times, and you feel your heart sink in the split seconds of darkness, but then it flares to life, and you feel only a moment of relief. It took maintenance a week to fix the lights last time they did this. Something to worry about later. You grab your dataslate and check today’s work schedule. Yep, even though you’re a pilot, they can’t just have you sitting around idle on days you aren’t in the cockpit. There’s always something going wrong on the station, and you’ve presumably got a pair of hands that can hold a wrench. Today you’re on air filter duty with the rest of your fireteam – dirty, ugly work, little better than wastewater maintenance. Might as well not bother with the shower until you’re finished. You fish out a reasonably clean jumpsuit, clamber into it, then grab your sturdiest pair of work boots and start to lace up. Welcome, as they say, to another day in Hell.*\n\n## BEAT 1 - ALL YE WHO ENTER HERE\nYou step out of your cramped little cabin, into another day full of backbreaking toil just to keep Hell’s Gate alive. Everything’s falling apart. The foundries run at lower efficiency every week. The heat management system is half a century past due for replacement. People report which part of the station they’re in by reading the error code off the nearest computer screen. The vent crab infestation is so bad some people have suggested just training them to show up for work shifts. There’s been power failures in Section 3B every day for a month. Oh, and last week, the printer broke, so there’s that. \n\n### RISE AND SHINE \nStart by introducing the players to Hell’s Gate – it will be their characters’ home for most of the campaign, so they should get familiar with it. The PCs have lived here long enough to get recruited into the station militia’s Strategic Response Team, so have them play out a few scenes and vignettes showcasing the station, their characters, and the relationship between both. \n\n### STATION OVERVIEW \nHell’s Gate consists of a swarming maze of material processing facilities about seven kilometers long, capped on each end by a docking bay and a rotating habitation ring. Directions on Hell’s Gate are usually referred to in reference to “fore” and “aft,” referring to the forward and rear docking bays and hab rings. The fore of the station was supposed to point in the general direction of whatever it was mining, ideally with the aft pointing away from Stygia’s gravity well. The last time the station had its facing adjusted was an emergency maneuver more than half a century ago, and nobody knows if it would survive a repeat performance. Mag-train lines run the length of the mid-station, allowing quick transport of goods and personnel across the station. It usually takes about twenty minutes for a mag-train to go from fore to aft, stopping at every terminal, but a militia emergency override can get you anywhere on the track in just under five minutes. Jerry frowns on misuse of this privilege. There are safe thoroughfares for “on-foot” personnel, but rare is the Gater who wants to travel seven kilometers in zero-g unassisted. The station was designed back when mechanized chassis were first becoming common, and so there are specially-rated train cars large enough to carry four Size 1 mechs or two Size 2 mechs. Size 3 mechs weren’t a thing at the time, but you can just about squeeze one of them into a car if it’s lying down. Since mechs aren’t usually needed outside the docking bays, the mech cars aren’t used often. The hab rings are just over 1400 meters in diameter, rotating at 1.1 rotations per minute. The rings spin oppositionally, clockwise from the perspective of someone looking out of their associated docking bay. This motion is tuned to provide a more or less perfect 1g of artificial gravity, although it’s fast enough that some sensitive individuals (mostly visitors) get motion sickness, or “the spins.” Directions on the rings are “spin” and “antispin,” with “down” pointing outwards from and “up” pointing inwards to the axis of spin. The rings are divided into three decks, with the upper deck being dedicated mostly to agricultural spaces and grow houses, the middle deck to habitation and business and the lower deck to maintenance and life support. Hell’s Gate has several kinetic and directed-energy weapons mounted on turrets across its hull, designed to give full coverage against encroaching debris, rock fragments and micrometeoroids. Although they aren’t officially rated for the purpose, they can also put holes in pirate mechs and subline vessels if need be. The station used to have a long-range mining laser mounted above the fore docking bay, but during the Demon Winter of 4992, the Hell Hounds stole it as they fled. Andros Capella mounted it on a turret at Fort Cerberus as a directional superweapon. The Gate maintains its own omninode, allowing station residents to access the omninet in real time, rather than relying on light-speed delayed broadcasts from the Union Neutral Omninode near Calliope’s star. The station also has a backup internal communications grid that uses rotary-dial telephones and teleprinters. It’s not cutting-edge, but it’s reliable, impossible to jam and stays operational even during station-wide blackouts. [54] [55] \n\n### LOCATIONS \n#### FORWARD DOCKING BAY \nThe Gate’s forward docking bay (colloquially, “the Mouth”) was meant to be oriented towards whatever the station was currently mining, but that was a long time ago. Mining vessels would arrive, drop off their raw ore, refuel and leave for another run while the ore was funneled into the station’s cavernous refineries. At its peak, the station was sending out five or six ships every day. Nowadays it’s lucky to get a couple out in a week. \n\nFORWARD HAB RING \nThe forward hab ring is by far the least well-maintained of the two, a fact that rankles the station’s Miners Union something fierce given that most of them live there. It’s still airtight, but there’s leaks in both the potable and waste water lines and the various grow-houses and hydroponics farms are pinched by materials shortages that don’t seem to hit the aft ring as hard. Jerry’s not blind to these problems, though; he lives here too. \n\nINDUSTRIAL SECTOR \nThe middle of the station is occupied by a long tangle of refineries, smelters, foundries and chemical plants. With all units online and functioning at peak efficiency, Hell’s Gate could render tens of thousands of tons of ore per hour into metal ingots, gravel, graphene and fullerenes. Nowadays, it’s barely operating 8%, and those aren’t working even close to peak due to staff shortages and a lack of maintenance. If Jerry hadn’t given himself a stomach ulcer negotiating with IPS-N for replacement parts, it’d be 4%, if that. OPS Part of the aft midstation is set aside for the Gate’s operations division. The station’s bridge is here, along with its omninode, primary reactor array, mainframes and harbor control. Aside from Central Fabrication, this is the most secure and well-armored part of the station. \n\nCENTRAL FABRICATION \nThis area houses the Gate’s Schedule 2 printer (Union certification 126 years out of date). There’s always a backlog of at least five to eight days on medium-priority orders, and a month minimum for low. High-priority orders (such as the PCs’ mechs) go through within hours, to the ire of whoever got bumped. What’s left of Jerry’s Sherman Mk. I, the Severance Pay, lies nearby, half-in half-out of the wall and swathed in cables. Its coldcore is currently being used as an auxiliary power source. \n\nMECH BAY \nBetween the aft docking bay and Central Fabrication there’s a large hangar dedicated to the storage and maintenance of the militia’s mechanized chassis, including those belonging to the PCs. Except in emergencies, combat-rated mechs are not permitted anywhere else on the station. AFT HAB RING More comfortable than the forward hab ring, the aft hab ring plays host to most of the station’s operational staff and acts as accommodation for the few guests and tourists the Gate receives. Unless they explicitly desire otherwise, all militia pilots – including the PCs – live here. At the very least, Jerry ensures the station’s defenders live comfortably. \n\nMILITIA MEMORIAL WALL \nA large wall in one of the aft ring’s public plazas has been dedicated as a place of remembrance to all those who died in the defense of Hell’s Gate. Every single militia member killed in action has an individual plaque engraved with their name, and there’s usually a little holo-widget displaying pictures of the deceased as well. Six new names have been added so far this year, all killed by the Hell Hounds. Andros Capella killed two of them himself, and is looking to up those numbers. \n\nDIRECTOR’S OFFICE \nAt one point in time, the Gate’s executive suite was a marvel of orbital decor. Situated in the aft hab ring, it was functional and stylish. It had real wood paneling and leather seats, gold inlay and paintings on the walls; not originals, of course, but high-quality reproductions. Lush houseplants flanked a viewscreen displaying the station. It even had a carpet. The wood was stripped out a century ago. The leather seats deteriorated beyond use. The inlay was recycled for circuitry repairs decades back. The paintings were sold to some casino on the Icebreaker just before Jerry took over, and Jerry has no time to look after plants. All that remains is a desk and endless piles of paperwork. It’s a sad, tired room for a sad, tired man. \n\nBRIEFING ROOM \nA bare chamber with a bunch of folding chairs, a holographic projector and a desk. The lights in here flicker sometimes, but the projector doesn’t, suggesting it’s wired into a better circuit. Jerry briefs the militia in here when their mission requires a more in-depth explanation than “please go shoot these pirates.” Jerry insists this room is a “no snack zone,” a prohibition no member of the militia has ever obeyed. \n\nAFT DOCKING BAY \nThe Gate’s aft docking bay (there’s a nickname for it, not said in polite company) handles the majority of the station’s space traffic, and was intentionally designed as such. The station’s designers imagined a bustling flight deck, with dozens of freighters passing in and out each day. That vision turned out as much of a joke as the bay’s nickname. The team’s personal corvette, the Dragon’s Tooth, is usually stationed here.\n\n\n\nADDITIONAL NPCS \nThis table contains some of the colourful characters the PCs can find around Hell’s Gate on any given day. \n\n1-2 CERULEAN ENCELADUS \nThe galaxy’s eighteenth most popular nu-retro-stasiscore musician. It’s not a very profitable gig, so he’s also the station’s fence. Everyone knows, nobody’s fooled, but Jerry doesn’t take any action because he’s also the only one on the station who can reliably source decent coffee. \n\n3-4 BOSS TEKA ASHENAFI \nThe leader of the Hell’s Gate Miners Union. Ashenafi has issues with Jerry’s management; namely, that a whole lot of the discretionary budget gets spent on the militia (which includes the PCs). He argues – not without merit – that the miners do the only work that generates real revenue for the station, but they don’t see anywhere near enough of the profits. He doesn’t hold a grudge against the PCs, but he’s not exactly friendly, either. \n\n5-6 ZIJAD AL-BASSA \nA technician in the station’s mech bay. Suspected to be a member of HORUS or Horizon, although it’s unclear which. Engages in lengthy philosophical dialogues regarding the sentience of COMP/CON units, often with COMP/CON units – who, curiously enough, always seem to agree with him. \n\n7-8 DR. TUULA VANHATALO \nThe Gate’s chief medical officer and one of its few officially licensed doctors. Perpetually busy. She has several diplomas on her wall, displaying her medical qualifications. Each of them has her picture, but was awarded to a different name, none of which are Tuula Vanhatalo. If she’s ever addressed by any of them, she’ll startle. \n\n9-10 MIKAELA OMNIDOCUMENT-FORMAT \nMikaela is a body-modification enthusiast who’s had a lot of work done. She’s usually browsing new mods on her cool augmented reality interface (you should get one!), and will constantly make recommendations to the PCs, or anyone else who’ll listen. Astute observers will notice that every mod she brings up is produced by an SSC subsidiary not usually available in the Long Rim. Often stands for long periods as if in a trance, seemingly unaware that she’s doing it. \n\n11-12 TARNVEER “PRINTLOAF” MALIK \nA member of the station militia who (on a dare, and against their own better judgement) asked Shelly to give them a callsign. Has resented Shelly ever since. They run a highly profitable side-gig selling stims, mostly to other militia members; they’ve definitely offered to hook the PCs up before. Pilots an IPS-N Lancaster with a muscular, scantily-clad man painted on the side, named Cock-A-Doodle-Doo. \n\n13-14 STEEPLE \nA hydroponics tech with a heavily scarred face and a large Mirrorsmoke Mercenary Company tattoo on his back. Terrible with people, but an absolute virtuoso with plants. Is the only reason anyone on the station ever gets to eat tomatoes. Always seems to be anemic. \n\n15-16 SAMORN PATALUNG \nThe kind, motherly proprietor of Happy Noodle, generally agreed to be the best noodle bar on the station. Most of the station thinks she’s a genius, on account of her ability to make vent crab meat taste of something. It’s an open secret that her establishment is a hangout for local HORUS elements, whom she affectionately calls “the dorks.” \n\n17-18 BARTENDER MOTHERFUCKER \nThe subaltern bartender of GMS_GENERIC_BAR, and the end result of a long series of in-jokes so dense as to be impossible to explain. Mixes an unrivalled Standard-Pattern GMS Margarita. Due to software defects endemic to Calliope COMP/CON units, BARTENDER is indefatigably upbeat and chipper at all times and in all circumstances, even when commiserating or offering condolences. \n\n19-20 ARGUS CHARON \nPLACEHOLDER\n\nDAILY LIFE \nThe station that would one day be named Hell’s Gate was built on dreams of exploiting a vast bounty of mineral wealth, but the market for its wares slowly dwindled to nothing. The company that owned it pulled out a century and a half ago, and for a century and a half it’s been a home for anyone who couldn’t afford to live anywhere else. Life’s hard here, but it’s still life, and it’s life without a high price tag or constant expectations. No matter how cold or unfriendly the directors of Hell’s Gate were, there was always one rule they never broke: nobody on the Gate has to pay to survive. If you’re absolutely flat broke, there’s a warm bunk, printloaf and clean water. Jerry hasn’t been a perfect administrator, but to this day he’s always managed to deliver on this one essential promise, no matter the cost to himself. No Gater can afford to be idle, though. Something’s always going wrong somewhere, and everyone pulls work shifts, even the militia, even members of the Strategic Response Team – and that means the PCs. The most important day-to-day tasks on the station are maintenance, mining and food production, and Jerry has tried his level best to provide them with the funding, materials and equipment they need to do their jobs. The station functions on Cradle Standard Time (or as close to it as possible), with a fourteen-hour day and ten-hour night cycle. Shelly assembles daily work schedules, and works out which tasks need to be assigned to whom. Depending on the task and its required manpower, shifts range from four to twelve hours in length. Shelly tries to ensure nobody works more than twelve hours at once or eighteen hours in a two-day period, but due to the shortage of qualified staff for certain tasks, she can’t always accommodate. The Gate has its own local currency: “ingots.” They’re flexible plastic notes shot through with metal. The value of an ingot depends on which metal is used in their production, and each ingot bears the likeness of the station director who issued their printing. There’s a print for Jerry, but he hasn’t had any made yet. Most petty transactions on the station are done using ingots, given that denominations like “ten-thousandths of a Manna” are difficult to work with. Through longstanding agreement, ingots are legal tender at other settlements in the system, although Impact Dynamics has been given increasingly low exchange rates lately. Anything that isn’t bought is traded for, and there’s a complex system of bartering, trust and favor exchange. It seems bewildering to outsiders, but after a few months of living there, you tend to get a feel for it: you can’t explain why a data storage card is worth three spice packets when it’s a friend asking and five when it’s a stranger, but it feels correct. On their time off, Gaters tend to be innovative and improvisational. Those who can’t afford to take a holiday on the Icebreaker tend to band together to find their own fun: “If you need a place to drink, there’s Aminata’s Saloon and GMS_GENERIC_BAR on the aft, and the fore has On the Rocks and Sol’s Bar and Grille. If you like sports, there’s a gravball court in one of the shuttered refineries, and it’s… mostly safe. “Clubs? Well, it’s nothing like the Icebreaker, but you can go to La Porte De L'Enfer or Never the Two Shall Meet if you want to be miserable. Steer clear of Transgressions unless you’re, uh… into stuff. If you’re not depressed or kinky, your options are sort of limited, but The Dockyard has decent music and the drinks aren’t too overpriced. “There’s video game tournaments every night at Sal’s Slate Shop, so long as the power’s on. If you like music, there’s a makeshift concert hall right next to the dispensary, although the water isn’t always steady there so take a bathroom break first. And if you’re religious, those odd firebird people set up a nondenominational house of worship in that old growhouse in section A3-27.” – Ayanda Delwayo, aeronautics engineer Hell’s Gate also plays host to a unique form of urban exploration: Gaters call it “cubbying.” The station hasn’t matched its original blueprints for decades – it probably didn’t when it was built. So much has been torn down and rebuilt or stolen that there's places and things in the station nobody knows about. On the other side of sealed bulkheads, behind keypads no-one remembers the combination for, through crawlspaces that haven’t been opened for a century, there are secrets waiting to be unearthed. Jerry has officially banned cubbying as a safety hazard, but he can’t really enforce it. In terms of politics, Hell’s Gate leans more towards the Horizon Collective than HORUS. This is in large part because Horizon has an active presence here helping people, but also because HORUS is associated with two of the system’s major pirate groups. The Circuit is openly a HORUS cell, but the Hell Hounds have also received funding from the Cousins, the strongest HORUS presence elsewhere in the Long Rim. Hell’s Gate has a PLACEHOLDER [62] SCENES FROM THE GATE 1-2 A team of stevedores yell in alarm as a cable on a cargo hoist gives way, spilling an entire pallet of crates onto the ground. 3-4 A militia pilot tells stories of their most recent battle against pirates to a couple of folk at a bar. It’s funny, though; you were in that fight, and they’re taking credit for things you or one of your teammates did. 5-6 A customer and the proprietor of a food stall exchange a deafening series of insults, profanities and curses, before cordially agreeing on a price as if nothing happened. They do this every day. 7-8 A pair of wrenchies bicker over different interpretations of the Duality. The guts of the power distributor they’re supposed to be fixing lie strewn around them, forgotten. 9-10 A work crew shuffles into a cafe after a shift, exhausted. The barista already has every single one of their orders ready, and is calling out names as they step in the door without even looking. 11-12 A furloughed mining crew loiters around an intersection, singing an old Long Rim work song. Most of them aren’t great singers individually, but put them together and they can belt. 13-14 A wake is being held for a recently passed resident of the station, and as is tradition, any property they didn’t leave to friends or family is being handed out to strangers. It’s considered rude not to take something. 15-16 A child giggles in delight as they ride around on the shoulders of a subaltern, which halts work every so often to politely request that the child stop climbing on them. 17-18 A timid mech tech shyly explains their job to someone who’s quite clearly attracted to them. Every so often, their timidness falls away as they get really into what they’re talking about, which just makes their companion more interested. 19-20 A hydroponic gardener who’s supposed to be selling her apples is just handing them out to a crowd of grateful children. You notice a wily one sneaking some ingots into her pocket anyway. EQUIPMENT Non-license weapons and systems available to pilots out of Hell’s Gate are often repurposed mining and salvage tools, or entirely novel ad-hoc inventions made to fill a specific niche. The following equipment can be handed out as personal rewards from grateful residents of Hell’s Gate, or by Jerry and Chief McElroy. Bronco Hook Auxiliary Melee, Exotic Gear, AP, Thrown 5 [a1] [1 i] On hit: the Bronco Hook sticks in the target. You may retrieve the Bronco Hook by any means you would retrieve a thrown weapon, and when you do, the target takes 1iAP. If you or the target move away from each other by any means, they take this damage and the Bronco Hook automatically returns to you. On miss: the Bronco Hook automatically returns to you if it was thrown. This appears to be a jury-rigged magnetic accelerator, designed to make tether points on asteroids by driving mech-scale pitons into them. Rule of thumb is if it can pierce a meter of asteroid rock, it can pierce ten centimeters of mech armor. Rebound Pulse Mineral Scanner 1 SP, Exotic Gear, Unique, Quick Tech 1/mission, you may activate this system to SCAN every character in a c7 area, then apply LOCK ON to the character with the most current HP. All hostile characters in the area also lose HIDDEN. A simple piece of tech found on almost every mining ship, modified to provide an effective battlefield reconnaissance tool. Its minimum safe stand-off distance is several hundred kilometers; anything less, and the ping-back is loud enough to blow out the antenna. The Grabber Heavy Melee, Exotic Gear [a2] [2d6i] On hit: you and your target each roll a contested HULL check. If you win the contested roll, your target is knocked PRONE. A standard piece of equipment found on mining and salvage rigs throughout the system; its official product name is the IPS-N Mechanized Chassis Remote Handling Tool, but that’s boring as hell, so most folks call it “the Grabber.” Not much work is needed to repurpose it to grab mechs instead of asteroids. Please note that such modification will void the warranty. [63 ] PILOT GEAR The following equipment represents some of the gear available to spacers and pilots in Calliope. IPS -N “Ahab” Grapple/Tether Line Gear, Limited 3 “You ever get the feeling nobody at IPS -N spends any time thinking about the names they give to things? Like, either I don’t read, so I don’t get the reference, or I do and I realize they named a survival tool after a dude who’s famous exclusively for getting dragged to his death tied to a whale.” You may expend a charge to shoot a hook at a character, object or free space up to b 5 away from you. You are attached to the hook by a tether, and cannot move or be moved further than five spaces away, unless you teleport, in which case the tether snaps. If the hook moves more than five spaces away, you are dragged along with it. As a quick action, you can reel yourself in, flying to the hook or as close to it as possible. This movement ignores engagement and doesn’t provoke reactions. You can detach from the tether as a full action. You can also retrieve a hook and tether that you are adjacent to as a full action, restoring a charge. Scramble Grenade Gear, Limited 1 This is actually a high -power, short -range distress beacon meant to help search -and -rescue teams locate astronauts who’ve been thrown into space. Some asshole discovered that if you jam a bunch of escape characters into the broadcast signal and overvolt the transmitter, you can make unshielded electronics shit themselves. It fries itself after a few seconds, a fate many wrenchies have wished upon its inventor. Expend a charge for the following effect: • Scramble Grenade (Grenade, b5, f 1): Affected characters without the BIOLOGICAL tag must succeed on a SYSTEMS save against 10 + your GRIT or become JAMMED until the end of their next turn.\n\n## COMBAT: A FACE TO A NAME\n\n*What tiny fragments remain of Andros Capella’s chassis drift lazily through the docking bay. All that’s left of the man is a carbon-black scorch mark on the deck plating. It takes you a moment to realize what you’ve done: you’ve killed the leader of one of Calliope’s most notorious pirate gangs. Processing the consequences of that will have to wait, though, as Siren contacts you again. SIREN: “Marines! whatever you just did, the pirates are peeling off, retreating – and we should too! I’m reading a massive thermal build-up in the ship’s drive core!”*\n\n#### FOLLOWING UP \nThe PCs have enough time to return to the Dragon’s Tooth, but give them a sense of urgency. If they want to grab more salvage, loot or intelligence from the Tachyon, make them roll a skill trigger. Emphasize the urgency of the situation; Siren makes increasingly desperate pleas for the PCs to return to the Dragon’s Tooth. Alarms start to sound across the Tachyon; the deck plating starts to rattle and dislodge. If the PCs attempt to override this process and halt the jump, they’ll discover they can’t: an administrative lockout is in effect. Voice authorization from Lead Researcher Jeanette Mkondo and Captain Stefan D’Antillio is required to override the lockout. Jeanette Mkondo can be found in the fabrication room (she’s the floating corpse), but Stefan D’Antillio is not presently aboard the vessel. You barely have time to strap yourself in before Siren sounds the hard-maneuver alarm. “Everybody hold onto your butts!” There’s a tremendous weight on your chest as the engines kick in, pressing you back into the chair. You close your eyes and struggle to breathe. Even with the aid of your hardsuit, you can barely move your fingers. The burn feels like it lasts forever. Grey starts to creep in around the edges of your vision. And then it’s done. It’s over. You’re through. You’re still accelerating at about two gees of thrust, but that’s far more manageable. You’re able to glance around the cabin, check on your fellow team members, look at your ship’s external feeds. There’s a moment of calm. Far behind you, the Tachyon and the Weasel are just a speck, barely visible against the darkness of space. Then there is a silent flash of blinding light. The Tachyon is gone – and with it, its secrets, the Ardent Weasel, and whatever dust remains of Andros Capella. Give the PCs a moment to reflect on all they’ve just witnessed before they start the long journey back to Hell’s Gate.\n\n\n## DOWNTIME 1 - DRINKS ARE ON ME\n\nIt takes another two weeks to return to Hell’s Gate. By then, the news is all over the system: Andros Capella is dead, and the PCs killed him. It doesn’t matter if that’s not what actually happened – the people of Calliope saw the PCs and Andros Capella walk into that ship, and only the PCs walked out. The Hell Hounds have sworn revenge for their slain leader, but rumor has it they’re in serious disarray and in no position to make good on those threats. Getting the printer part to the station relieves an immense amount of pressure, alleviating the many precarious shortages the station was experiencing. Tick a segment on the Station Stability clock. Additionally, if the clock has four or more segments filled, Jerry is able to set aside a little something as thanks for the players. The PCs gain Jerry’s Care Package, which they can use later, in Chapter 2. Jerry’s Care Package Favors, Limited 2 A bunch of Icebreaker currency, a few backstage passes, a case of Elysian champagne, a scrawled note containing the passphrases to several of the “niche interest” clubs and VIP tickets to the next championship mech bout. Kick your feet up and relax. You deserve it! Expend a charge when you’re on the Icebreaker and not in immediate danger. You can take a Downtime Action appropriate to the situation, right now. Regardless, the players are able to undertake a FULL REPAIR now that the printer is running again, and with a moment to breathe, they can take a downtime action. At some point, Jerry signs some requisition forms and the PCs advance to LICENSE LEVEL 1. Run a few vignettes to explain how they get their new gear. Encourage the PCs to spend time around Hell’s Gate, building on relationships they developed over the course of the chapter. The Gate, now in much better repair and under far less strain on its resources, is fully open to them. Given the tenuous situation with the pirates, however, Jerry still won’t authorize unescorted trips off the station. If the PCs need reserves, there’s places on Hell’s Gate they might get them. Jerry, Chief McElroy or Zinfandel aren’t exactly flush with spare supplies, but they’d certainly be willing to do a few favors for the people who saved the station. The Horizon Collective has a subaltern clinic on the aft hab ring, and they always seem to be well-stocked. There’s a thriving grey market among the militia, and there’s always traders in port who might have something you’re looking for. If nothing else, you can always go trawling through the junk-yards and trash-heaps – it’s not dignified or hygienic, but even in space, people throw an awful lot of useful stuff away. \n\n### HELL’S GATE DOWNTIME ACTIVITIES \nHere are some downtime actions specific to Hell’s Gate that the PCs can undertake now, or whenever they have downtime on the station. You can also create your own using these or the ones in Lancer or The Long Rim as starting points. \n\n#### PITCH IN \nYou volunteer for extra work shifts and get down to the difficult business of keeping Hell’s Gate running for another week. It’s tiring, dangerous and often thankless. But this is work that someone needs to do, and if nobody volunteers, you’re all just drifting. Explain the work you’re putting in and roll: On 9 or less, you do more to hinder than help. You get in the way, make poor decisions or distract other workers. After a couple of days of this, you’re asked not to show up for shifts anymore. Take +1h to interactions with the Gate’s residents until the next downtime. On 10-19, with a staggering amount of effort, and many nights with too little sleep, you’re able to make some headway in tackling the station’s innumerable problems. Gain +1g on interactions with Hell’s Gate residents until the next downtime. On 20+, not only do you solve a major problem that was causing a lot of people grief. Tick one segment on the Station Stability clock, and gain +1g on interactions with Hell’s Gate residents until the next downtime. If multiple characters take this action, roll once for each character and take the best result instead of applying each result individually. The Station Stability clock only gets incremented once, but social bonuses or penalties apply to all participating characters.\n\n#### GO CUBBYING \nYou strap on a mobility hardsuit, pack a few rations and set off into the station’s abandoned sectors. Some only have emergency lighting. Some are without power. Some aren’t even pressurized. But all of them have something interesting hidden inside, if you can find it. Describe your exploration, then roll: On 9 or less, you get trapped behind a security door, stuck in a vent or just hopelessly lost. You’re forced to call for rescue. Jerry tearfully chews you out for setting a bad example, and has a maintenance team seal off a few common access points that cubbyers use. No other PC can take this action until next downtime, and you become persona non grata at the Gate’s cubbying club. On 10-19, you find something interesting on your explorations: a forgotten cache of supplies, a functional console with useful data, an access card to a door nobody’s been able to open, or something like that. You can treat these as RESERVES, as useful materials for a future downtime action like Get Creative, or as currency to give you +1g on a few social rolls. On 20+, not only do you find a bunch of useful stuff, you actually discover something in a forgotten corner of the station that’s been causing a bunch of those problems the wrenchies couldn’t figure out how to fix. You get all the benefits of a 10-19 result and you tick one segment on the Station Stability clock. Jerry finally eases up on the whole cubbying deal, so the station’s cubbying club now thinks you’re rad as fuck. The Station Stability clock can only increment once per downtime from this action, but any number of characters can roll this activity separately and reap its other benefits. \n\n#### TAKE A BREAK \nJerry has added a few days leave to your file – a rare privilege on Hell’s Gate. You decide to spend some of them right now, de-stress and recharge your batteries after the hectic few weeks you’ve had. Explain how you’re de-stressing, and then roll: \nOn 9 or less, you just can’t switch off. It’s hard to sleep, and nothing seems to help. You have a rough few days. But one morning, you wake up, step outside and find a little care package with some of your favorite snacks inside. There’s a little note signed by more than sixty people. It says “thank you for keeping us safe.” One of the kids drew your mech. They really do care. \nOn 10-19, you feel a bit of the weight lift off your shoulders. You catch a good night’s sleep for the first time in ages. Oh, and you made a friend! The GM can roll on the Additional NPCs table from Beat 1: All Ye Who Enter (p. 60), or invent their own. \nOn 20+, you feel better than you’ve felt in years! You’re more ready to face the world than you ever were before. Take two counters. They represent a well of renewed confidence. During the next mission, you can spend a counter on an attack, check or save you make to treat the result of the d20 roll as a 10. \n\n#### JOIN A CREW \nNow that the scanning array is back online and the pirates are out of the way for a while, salvage and mining runs are starting up again. You check your hardsuit seals, pack your bag, join a crew and spend a couple of weeks out in a wreck or an asteroid cluster. If you’re not the mining or salvaging type, you can still bring your mech, keeping the team safe while they work; guardians get a cut, just like everyone else. Create a six-segment Salvage clock on your character sheet, then roll: On 9 or less, fill in one segment on the Materials clock. On 10-19, fill in two segments on the Materials clock, and gain one item of particular interest. Roll 1d20 to see what you find. This can be used as Reserves, pilot gear, or to gain +1g on a couple of relevant skill checks. On 20+, due to your stellar performance on this run, the team votes you for first pick. Fill in three segments on the Materials clock, then roll 2d20, choosing one result. From now on, you can clear segments on the Salvage clock for the following benefits: • 1 segment: Gain +1g on one skill check to invent, create or repair items, or on one skill check to barter, negotiate or bribe. • 2 segments: During any downtime, gain one piece of Mech Equipment and Gear (Lancer, p. 51) as Reserves. • 6 segments: During any downtime on Hell’s Gate, tick one segment on the Station Stability clock.\n\n\n\n# END OF CHAPTER 1","lastmodified":"2022-11-06T04:54:24.016479644Z","tags":null},"/GM/Plotting/Structure":{"title":"","content":"Since the foundation campaign 'In Golden Flame' is currently in playtest beta, and that is only for ACT 1, I have no desire to carry forth without a key outline of the campaign going forward, or the work put in to develop ACT 2 and 3, it would not be fair on myself to carry the voice of the campaign forward, and it would not be fair on my players to present a diminished experience.  \n  \nIn order to avoid burnout, the following plan is recommended.\n\n1.

It culminates in a battle that hints at the full extent of the Cult’s capabilities and ambitions.\n\nAct 2 will cover Tier 2 play from LL 5-9. Stones are thrown into Calliope’s pond as several new factions arrive, each presenting their own opportunities and dangers to the system’s residents. While the team contend with these newcomers, they must also recruit allies and strengthen Calliope against the rapidly encroaching Cult. These preparations will be put to the test during a climactic assault on their home\n\nAct 3 will cover Tier 3 play from LL9-12. This is the endgame. The Cult is now in open war with the rest of the system as it rushes to achieve its final, apocalyptic vision. Lives hang in the balance, and the player characters must pit their war machines against the servants of an awakening god.","lastmodified":"2022-11-06T04:54:24.016479644Z","tags":null},"/Sessions/2022-11-06-Session-3":{"title":"","content":"# CHAPTER 1 Cont.\n\n*What tiny fragments remain of Andros Capella’s chassis drift lazily through the docking bay. All that’s left of the man is a carbon-black scorch mark on the deck plating. It takes you a moment to realize what you’ve done: you’ve killed the leader of one of Calliope’s most notorious pirate gangs. Processing the consequences of that will have to wait, though, as Siren contacts you again. SIREN: “Marines! whatever you just did, the pirates are peeling off, retreating – and we should too! I’m reading a massive bleed in the ship’s mana core, this shift is going to be ugly!”*\n\n#### FOLLOWING UP \nThe PCs have enough time to return to the Dragon’s Tooth, but give them a sense of urgency. If they want to grab more salvage, loot or intelligence from the Tachyon, make them roll a skill trigger. Emphasize the urgency of the situation; Siren makes increasingly desperate pleas for the PCs to return to the Dragon’s Tooth. Rumbles start to roll down the Tachyon; the decking starts to rattle and splinter. \n\n*Then there is a silent flash of blinding light. The Tachyon and Weasel are gone. You barely have time to grab something before Siren screams for everyone to hard brace. \"Everybody hold onto your butts!”\nYou feel can feel the Dragon's Tooth begin to tilt and yaw, mana seizing the space the Tachyon once filled, threatening to bring the Dragon's Tooth into the rift. There’s a tremendous weight on your chest as the sails kick in, and Siren fights the current, pressing you back into the chair. You close your eyes and struggle to breathe. Even with the aid of your hardsuit, you can barely think, mana bleeding around your synapses. The tumble feels like it lasts forever. Blue starts to creep in around the edges of your vision. And then it’s done. It’s over. You’re through. You’re still driting away at about two notts of thrust, but the pressure is far more manageable.* \n\nYou’re able to glance around the cabin, check on your fellow team members, look at your ship’s scry orb. \n\n*There’s a moment of calm. Behind you, the Tachyon and the Weasel are gone, Siren comments: \"likely forever folding between the planes, a thousand pieces tumbling apart, with no binding enchantment to ever draw them home.\" – and with it you realise, its secrets, the Ardent Weasel, and whatever scorch mark remains of Andros Capella.* \n\nGive the PCs a moment to reflect on all they’ve just witnessed before they start the long journey back to Hell’s Gate. But don't wait too long, it takes another two weeks to return to Hell’s Gate. \n\n#### DOWNTIME 1\nBy then, the news is all over the region: Andros Capella is dead, and the PCs killed him. It doesn’t matter if that’s not what actually happened – the diviners and pirates of Calliope saw the PCs and Andros Capella walk into that ship, and only the PCs walked out. The Hell Hounds have sworn revenge for their slain leader, but rumor has it they’re in serious disarray and in no position to make good on those threats. Getting the weaver part to the city relieves an immense amount of pressure, alleviating the many precarious shortages the city was experiencing. \nTick a segment on the City Stability clock. \nAdditionally, if the clock has four or more segments filled, Jerry is able to set aside a little something as thanks for the players. \n\nThe PCs gain Jerry’s Care Package, which they can use later, in Chapter 2. \n\n**Jerry’s Care Package Favors** \nLimited 2 \n\u003e *A bunch of Icebreaker currency, a few backstage passes, a case of Elysian champagne, a scrawled note containing the passphrases to several of the “niche interest” clubs and VIP tickets to the next championship mech bout. Kick your feet up and relax. You deserve it!*\nExpend a charge when you’re on the Icebreaker and not in immediate danger. You can take a Downtime Action appropriate to the situation, right now. \n\nRegardless, the players are able to undertake a **FULL REPAIR** now that the weaver is running again, and with a moment to breathe, they can take a downtime action. \n\nAt some point, Jerry signs some requisition forms and the PCs advance to **LICENSE LEVEL 1**. Run a few vignettes to explain how they get their new gear. Encourage the PCs to spend time around Hell’s Gate, building on relationships they developed over the course of the chapter. \n\nThe Gate, now in much better repair and under far less strain on its resources, is fully open to them. Given the tenuous situation with the pirates, however, Jerry still won’t authorize unescorted trips off the city. \n\nIf the PCs need reserves, there’s places on Hell’s Gate they might get them. Jerry, Chief McElroy or Zinfandel aren’t exactly flush with spare supplies, but they’d certainly be willing to do a few favors for the people who saved the city. \nThe Horizon Collective has a subterrainian clinic on the aft-side,  and they always seem to be well-stocked. \nThere’s a thriving grey market among the militia, and there’s always traders in port who might have something you’re looking for. \nIf nothing else, you can always go trawling through the scrap-yards and trash-heaps – it’s not dignified or hygienic, but even in space, people throw an awful lot of useful stuff away. \n\n## END OF CHAPTER 1\n\n# CHAPTER 2 \"ICE AND FIRE\"\n\nA couple of weeks to a month after the PCs return from the Tachyon, Jerry calls them into the briefing room again. Unusually, he asks them to clean up, dress formally and be on their best behaviour for this meeting. When you enter the room, you notice you and Jerry aren’t its only occupants – sort of. The vidscreen displays the flickering image of a severe woman in a crisp white suit. As you arrive, she narrows her eyes. Jerry adjusts his collar nervously. “So, uh, in case you don’t know, this is Rita, station director on the Icebreaker Borealis. My counterpart!” When she speaks, it’s in a cool, level tone. “Good morning. I’ve heard a lot about you from Jerry and from system gossip. Word is we have you to thank for Andros Capella exiting the stage. Good work! I’m glad Hell’s Gate is finally cleaning up its messes.” Jerry looks upset by this statement, but Rita cuts him off before he can speak. “Let’s get down to business. Jerry says that since you sent the Hell Hounds packing, salvage and mining crews have been able to get to work properly for the first time in months. “Well, you’re in luck. The Icebreaker is undertaking some major expansion projects this quarter, and I’m willing to offer guaranteed, above-market prices for anything you’re selling; raw materials, construction equipment, salvage, whatever. I’ll even comp you and your freighter crews for a few nights on the town. I have one condition.” Jerry takes a deep breath. “You always do, Rita.” Rita shoots a withering glare at Jerry, before continuing. “I want to subcontract your team. I have a very sensitive job that needs a competent crew. You fit the profile, and critically, you’re not working for anyone on the Board.” Rita isn’t the most patient soul in the world, but she does understand the team will probably have a lot of questions, so she politely answers them. WHY US? “Like I said, you’re competent, you’re available, you’re reliable – or so Jerry tells me, at least. But most importantly, you’re not under the thumb of anyone on the Board. That aspect, in fact, is perhaps your most important quality: it means that I can convince the Board to pay you.” She rubs the bridge of her nose irritably. “The Board are a gaggle of paranoid, squabbling toddlers. When anything – and I do mean anything – goes wrong with anyone’s business, they immediately suspect a plot by one of their rivals. And let me clarify: everyone – and I do mean everyone – on the Board are rivals. “They’d never authorise me to hire any member’s private security team for this job, and I can’t trust anyone in the station’s mutual defence force either. I need a small, competent team from outside the Icebreaker’s usual sphere. You killed Andros Capella, and beheaded one of the system’s most dangerous pirate groups. Put simply: you qualify.” THE JOB “I’m going to have to ask you to wait until you arrive on the Icebreaker for specific briefings, but in general terms: I suspect a plot against the Board from an external force. Odd things have been happening recently, both on the station and in our orbital neighbourhood. Power fluctuations, system intrusions, missing persons, traffic irregularities. “Everyone on the Board thinks it’s someone else on the Board, and yes, it’s true they’re always plotting against each other. But this feels different, in a way I can’t quite quantify. Things are happening that wouldn’t benefit anyone in the station’s current order. Customers are discontent. There’s grumbling from residents. Seasonal workers are getting spooked. “No, everyone’s losing money on this. I need you to look into this matter, and put a stop to it. I’m willing to pay top ice to see it done.” THE PAY “Well, as I previously mentioned, I’ll offer guaranteed prices on everything your station is willing to sell to us. I know the Gate is always in need of cash. “I’ll also open a budget for reasonable expenses. As long as you don’t abuse my generosity too much, you and your freighter crews don’t have to spend a single icicle of your own during your stay. I don’t want anyone – the culprits included – to suspect I’ve brought in outside investigators, so I want you to be seen around the station, spending money like everyone else. It just won’t be your money. “Lastly, I happen to have better contacts than Jerry does, and if you need more powerful hardware, I can hook you up – once I start seeing results, of course.” [86] JERRY’S OPINION Jerry scratches his head self-consciously. “My? Opinion? Oh, right. I mean… killing Andros Capella kicked the Hell Hounds real good. They’re making, uh, they’re making all sorts of threats that they’re in no state to carry out. The Gate’ll be, it’ll be fine until you get back. The militia’s got this locked down. “But we could really use money. And… well, the Icebreaker is one of our biggest customers. And they’re offering guaranteed prices on our goods. That’s… that’s pretty good, guys? Plus, plus, Rita knows some people. She can hook you up with mech stuff we just don’t have the budget for. “She can be…” Jerry pauses for a moment, as Rita’s glare sharpens to a razor point. “… cold, sometimes. But you can trust her implicitly.” You see just a split second of emotion pass across Rita’s face, before the stoic mask reasserts itself. PRIOR TO DEPARTURE The PCs have a little time to spend on Hell’s Gate before they leave. Since they’re about to spend a whole mission away on the Icebreaker, this is a good chance for them to engage with some of the Gate’s NPCs. Here are some suggestions for things that might be going on around the Gate right now: • Jerry’s stressed, which isn’t unusual, but it seems to be specifically related to Rita. If pressed on the issue, he admits that he used to be involved with her. But then he became station director, and a relationship between two station directors was never going to end well. • Chief McElroy is watching every single print job like an angry hawk. She says her vigilance is critical to prevent a repeat of the accident that nearly crippled the station. The print team say it’s only preventing an end to the backlog the accident caused. • Zinfandel is a little concerned about the threats the Hell Hounds have been making, and is stepping up patrols of Stygia’s orbital neighborhood. • Printloaf wants to expand their selection of stims, which is running a little thin. The Dragon’s Tooth won’t be subject to the same customs checks that other ships are, which means it’d be easier to run product back from the Icebreaker. Printloaf’s willing to cut the team in on the profits if they help; ten percent is fair, right? • Samorn Patalung mentions there’s a Horizon Collective repair shop on the Icebreaker. The HORUS dorks who hang out at her stand have talked about wanting to knock it over for a while – go and warn them, maybe? • Striga Von Aldenberg is inconsolable with worry over the PCs’ safety, insisting that the Icebreaker is “a wretched den of schemes, intrigue and skullduggery.” She’s very coherent today, actually; all the plots and conspiracies that she’s describing are well-evidenced and verifiable. It’s kind of unsettling. Then she goes off about how a secret apocalypse cult has started operating there, and it’s back to business as usual. • Boss Teka Ashenafi accosts a PC – one who he’s on decent terms with, hopefully – and starts asking pointed questions about mining contracts. He’s heard some rumors on the grapevine about a big job in the system, and he wants to make sure Jerry is putting a bid in for it. Give a general impression of how Hell’s Gate is faring at the moment, depending on the status of the Station Stability clock. If it only has a couple of segments ticked, things won’t look great: flickering lights, queues for essential supplies, jury-rigged fixes due to parts shortages, grime and an overall air of melancholy. This isn’t anything new, incidentally; this is just how life on Hell’s Gate usually is. On the other hand, if the clock is at three or four segments, the PCs have been putting in the work, and it’s starting to show. Things look a little cleaner and a little brighter. There’s the parts and the time to make proper repairs. Shortages are easing and people can afford little luxuries. Citizens’ lives are better because of what the PCs did – make sure they know that.\n\nThe journey from Hell’s Gate to the Icebreaker Borealis takes about eleven days. The PCs travel in the Dragon’s Tooth, as one of the escorts for the convoy of freighters hauling metal ingots, polycrete and salvage. Their trip is comfortable and uneventful.\n\n*As the cloudy, sand-yellow sphere of Kalevala and its majestic ring system grows in your vision, a small, bright dot grows with it, perched high in orbit. Within hours, that dot resolves into a vast, tangled cylinder of habitats anchored to the remains of an immense mining frigate. The station spills bright neon light into the void, and local space is a hive of activity, dozens of ships arriving and leaving at this very moment. The Icebreaker’s main port works just fine, and docking is a quick and painless process. The fun doesn’t start until you take an elevator down the struts into the Sprawl. In the Grand Concourse that marks the start of the Starstrip, a man is waiting for you – one of the greeters. He explains your hotel reservations, recommends several of the station’s attractions, ensures that you receive all your complimentary gift vouchers, and then very quietly informs you that a meeting has been scheduled for you at lunch tomorrow, in the backroom of the Uncrowned King bar and grille. Until then, you’re told to blend in and enjoy yourselves.*\n\n##### RADIO GAGA\nAt some point, have this play over the radio to a player\n*“Well, listeners, we’ve had one hell of a show, and I’ll leave you with this thought. Been over two months since the devil Andros Capella vanished in a slip, but don’t it feel like the after-image barely left our eyes? When you shut them, can’t you still see it? That rift, flicking there and then not before your retinas?\n“Seems nobody can get Capella’s dyin’ out of their sight. Whole region’s been awash in the names of the chosen who killed him – and the way I hear it, over both raised drinks and sharpened knives. What must it be like to be the chosen who killed the Hound of Hell? To most, you’re a hero, scratchin’ out a threat to Calliope’s spacelanes. To others, you’re an enemy, a threat who needs scratchin’ out yourself. But perhaps most unsettlin’ of all, listeners, imagine this: to a very few people you’re somethin’ else entirely: a curiosity. Somethin’ that warrants further examination – and that examination could be the ‘friendly chat’ kind, or it could be the ‘insect under glass’ kind. “If you’re out there, Chosen, if you’re listenin’? Stay safe. Seems like you’re the main characters of Calliope today. “This is Irvin Reid for Icebreaker Public Radio, tellin’ you to… stay cool out there.”*\n\n\n## BEAT 2 - A CONTRACT THRILLER\nThe PCs have a whole afternoon, evening and morning to themselves. They may each take one downtime action, as long as it would fit in that timescale. There’s time for a few hours at a casino, a night out drinking, or a morning of networking and seeking out contacts. When the PCs have finished whatever they’re doing before the meeting, Rita is waiting for them at the Uncrowned King. \n\n*Rita takes a deep breath. “Alright. I’ve got a lot of things to get through, so listen closely. The situation’s developed since I first called you in, and not in a good way, either.\"\n“Firstly. Two weeks ago, Serendipitous Vitamin, a census officer and a member of my Civic Management bureau, was murdered in his home by a single shot to the back of the head. No signs of struggle or forced entry. Later that evening, his office was ransacked. “The very next morning, just before I called you in, one of Civic Management’s data-centers was raided by a small paramilitary group who we’ve been unable to identify. They took the staff hostage, but no-one was hurt, thank the Buddha. They deleted every record they could get their hands on, trashed the place and then vanished. It was in the middle of a backup cycle, so we’ve lost a week’s worth of data, including the off-site copy of Vitamin’s notes. “Secondly, someone forged my credentials, and wrote a false work order to have repair work done on the Borealis’ main reactor array. They got some… charitable religious group, the Faith of the One Plumed in Golden Flame? Well, they did the repairs. “Then, somehow, Fayad Harb, the boss of the engineer’s union, got word of all of this. Now he’s furious at me because he thinks I used non-union labor, and the entire tech union are on strike. “As if all that wasn’t bad enough, Harrison Armory’s on my case about some missing scientist of theirs. They hold me personally responsible for finding her – as if I’m supposed to keep tabs on two million people visiting my station at any given moment! “Add to that the printers have been going haywire for weeks, there’s power fluctuations, pop-up protests… I’m positive. Someone is fucking with my station. I want them found, and I want them stopped. “Just one issue: the Board hasn’t authorized this operation. They don’t even know about it. I can persuade them to grant ex-post-facto legitimacy once you deliver results, but nobody on the board will sign off on activating you right now. There’s too little trust. In short: stick to investigation until you have a solid lead, and confine your efforts to the Sprawl. I retain the final word on whether or not you deploy mechs. Keep that in your mind at all times. “I’m currently holding your mechs in storage. When you need them, here is a secure contact channel. I’ll need a good justification for the deployment of military hardware on my station before I release them. Understood?”* \n\nRita is happy to provide more detail on any of these topics if the PCs enquire. \nAt some point in the conversation, Rita is rudely interrupted. It happens quite suddenly: every screen in the room goes blank for a moment, and then displays an emergency alert. Sirens start sounding. Surprisingly, Rita doesn’t panic. Instead, she just groans loudly and buries her head in her hands. After a few seconds, the sirens stop, and everything goes back to normal. *“Oh, me cago en diez! They promised me they’d fixed that. No, don’t get up, don’t get up. That’s another thing I was meaning to mention. Every single day, at the exact same time, the station’s general alarm goes off. If all of this other shit wasn’t going on, I’d think it was someone’s sick idea of a joke.”* \n\n##### SERENDIPITOUS VITAMIN’S MURDER \n“I mean, it could have just been a crime of passion, but I don’t buy it. It was premeditated, quiet and professional. He was on to something, and somebody killed him to cover it up. If you need more information, talk to Officer Lamariano.” \n\n##### DATACENTRE ATTACK \n“Well, it was probably to destroy Serendipitous Vitamin’s notes before they made it onto an off-site backup. There’s a hostile strike team operating on my station and we can’t keep track of them. I want you to make finding them and shutting them down a priority. Officer Narangerel is head of that investigation. Talk to her.” \n\n##### FORGED CREDENTIALS AND REACTOR REPAIRS \n“Let me worry about the forged credentials. What I want you looking into is why someone wanted the reactors repaired. If this was just a charity case, why would they need to fake a work order from me to get them online again? No, nobody does that sort of thing if they have an altruistic motive. “The best people to talk to about this would be members of the tech union. Unfortunately, a whole lot of them are strike right now. I guess you could also talk to the Faith of the One, since they did the repairs. They insist they were just following the work order they got given. Not sure if I trust them, though.”\n\n##### FAYAD HARB’S STRIKE \n“I can’t get through to Fayad. And it hurts! He’s one of my closest allies on the Board. He thinks I snubbed him by using non-union labour. Now the [100] engineer’s union is striking, and they’re only responding to emergency callouts. Work is piling up, and visitors are starting to complain. Maybe you’ll have better luck talking to him. “It’s not exactly as if he’ll be hard to find. He’s still protesting right outside my office.” \n\n##### MISSING HARRISON ARMORY SPECIALIST \n“Dr. Genevieve Nyambose. She went missing just a day after you left Hell’s Gate. Some specialist researcher or something. The Armory’s threatening legal proceedings against the Board if I don’t get her back. They won’t win, but that’s not the problem: they’re also threatening a boycott, and they’re one of our largest visitor demographics. “If you want to try talking to them, you can speak to Sergeant Hemmingsen. Don’t expect a warm welcome.”\n\n##### LACK OF BOARD AUTHORISATION \n“If I suggested hiring external contractors, each member of the Board would instantly work it into one of their grand conspiracy theories. They’d think I’d lost my neutrality, that I’m plotting with one of them against the rest. So I had to take unilateral action without their approval. “You have to understand my position. The Board is a gaggle of psychotic toddlers, and they all have guns and lawyers. I have to be the one adult in the room, and like any spoilt child, they resent me for it. Every day I wake up and spend dawn ‘til dusk trying to save these puerile dipshits from themselves, often against their will, so they don’t tear this station apart or accidentally dump us into Kalevala’s atmosphere. “Painfully often, I have to justify my actions after the fact, when I don’t have weeks or months to play kindergarten teacher.

Ensure that code block titles are enabled in Quartz's configuration:\n\n    ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\n    enableCodeBlockTitle: true\n    ```\n\n2. Add the `title` attribute to the desired [code block\n   fence](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#highlighting-in-code-fences):\n\n      ```markdown {linenos=false}\n       ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n       enableCodeBlockTitle: true  # example from step 1\n       ```\n      ```\n\n**Note** that if `{title=\u003cmy-title\u003e}` is included, and code block titles are not\nenabled, no errors will occur, and the title attribute will be ignored.\n\n### HTML Favicons\nIf you would like to customize the favicons of your Quartz-based website, you \ncan add them to the `data/config.yaml` file. The **default** without any set \n`favicon` key is:\n\n```html {title=\"layouts/partials/head.html\", linenostart=15}\n\u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThe default can be overridden by defining a value to the `favicon` key in your \n`data/config.yaml` file. For example, here is a `List[Dictionary]` example format, which is\nequivalent to the default:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon:\n  - { rel: \"shortcut icon\", href: \"icon.png\", type: \"image/png\" }\n#  - { ... } # Repeat for each additional favicon you want to add\n```\n\nIn this format, the keys are identical to their HTML representations.\n\nIf you plan to add multiple favicons generated by a website (see list below), it\nmay be easier to define it as HTML. Here is an example which appends the \n**Apple touch icon** to Quartz's default favicon:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon: |\n  \u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n  \u003clink rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"180x180\" href=\"/apple-touch-icon.png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThis second favicon will now be used as a web page icon when someone adds your \nwebpage to the home screen of their Apple device. If you are interested in more \ninformation about the current and past standards of favicons, you can read \n[this article](https://www.emergeinteractive.com/insights/detail/the-essentials-of-favicons/).\n\n**Note** that all generated favicon paths, defined by the `href` \nattribute, are relative to the `static/` directory.\n\n### Graph View\nTo customize the Interactive Graph view, you can poke around `data/graphConfig.yaml`.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/graphConfig.yaml\"}\n# if true, a Global Graph will be shown on home page with full width, no backlink.\n# A different set of Local Graphs will be shown on sub pages.\n# if false, Local Graph will be default on every page as usual\nenableGlobalGraph: false\n\n### Local Graph ###\nlocalGraph:\n    # whether automatically generate a legend\n    enableLegend: false\n    \n    # whether to allow dragging nodes in the graph\n    enableDrag: true\n    \n    # whether to allow zooming and panning the graph\n    enableZoom: true\n    \n    # how many neighbours of the current node to show (-1 is all nodes)\n    depth: 1\n    \n    # initial zoom factor of the graph\n    scale: 1.2\n    \n    # how strongly nodes should repel each other\n    repelForce: 2\n\n    # how strongly should nodes be attracted to the center of gravity\n    centerForce: 1\n\n    # what the default link length should be\n    linkDistance: 1\n    \n    # how big the node labels should be\n    fontSize: 0.6\n    \n    # scale at which to start fading the labes on nodes\n    opacityScale: 3\n\n### Global Graph ###\nglobalGraph:\n\t# same settings as above\n\n### For all graphs ###\n# colour specific nodes path off of their path\npaths:\n  - /moc: \"#4388cc\"\n```\n\n\n## Styling\nWant to go even more in-depth? You can add custom CSS styling and change existing colours through editing `assets/styles/custom.scss`. If you'd like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in `/layouts/partials`. \n\n### Partials\nPartials are what dictate what gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in `/layouts`.\n\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through `/layouts/index.html`. To customize the footer, you can edit `/layouts/partials/footer.html`\n\nMore info about partials on [Hugo's website.](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/)\n\nStill having problems? Checkout our [FAQ and Troubleshooting guide](notes/troubleshooting.md).\n\n## Language Support\n[CJK + Latex Support (测试)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(测试).md) comes out of the box with Quartz.\n\nWant to support languages that read from right-to-left (like Arabic)? Hugo (and by proxy, Quartz) supports this natively.\n\nFollow the steps [Hugo provides here](https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/#configure-languages) and modify your `config.toml`\n\nFor example:\n\n```toml\ndefaultContentLanguage = 'ar'\n[languages]\n  [languages.ar]\n    languagedirection = 'rtl'\n    title = 'مدونتي'\n    weight = 1\n```\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-06T04:54:24.016479644Z","tags":null},"/notes/custom-Domain":{"title":"Custom Domain","content":"\n### Registrar\nThis step is only applicable if you are using a **custom domain**!

You can organize content into any folder you'd like.\n\n**To edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.**\n\nTo create a link between notes in your garden, just create a normal link using Markdown pointing to the document in question. Please note that **all links should be relative to the root `/content` path**. \n\n```markdown\nFor example, I want to link this current document to `notes/config.md`.\n[A link to the config page](notes/config.md)\n```\n\nSimilarly, you can put local images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\nYou can also use wikilinks if that is what you are more comfortable with!\n\n### Front Matter\nHugo is picky when it comes to metadata for files. Make sure that your title is double-quoted and that you have a title defined at the top of your file like so. You can also add tags here as well.\n\n```yaml\n---\ntitle: \"Example Title\"\ntags:\n- example-tag\n---\n\nRest of your content here...\n```\n\n### Obsidian\nI recommend using [Obsidian](http://obsidian.md/) as a way to edit and grow your digital garden.

Set a custom domain here if you have one!\n\n![Enable GitHub Pages](/notes/images/github-pages.png)*Enable GitHub Pages*\n\n### Pushing Changes\nTo see your changes on the internet, we need to push it them to GitHub. Quartz is a `git` repository so updating it is the same workflow as you would follow as if it were just a regular software project.\n\n```shell\n# Navigate to Quartz folder\ncd \u003cpath-to-quartz\u003e\n\n# Commit all changes\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"message describing changes\"\n\n# Push to GitHub to update site\ngit push origin hugo\n```\n\nNote: we specifically push to the `hugo` branch here. Our GitHub action automatically runs everytime a push to is detected to that branch and then updates the `master` branch for redeployment.\n\n### Setting up the Site\nNow let's get this site up and running. Never hosted a site before? No problem. Have a fancy custom domain you already own or want to subdomain your Quartz? That's easy too.\n\nHere, we take advantage of GitHub's free page hosting to deploy our site. Change `baseURL` in `/config.toml`. \n\nMake sure that your `baseURL` has a trailing `/`!\n\n[Reference `config.toml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/config.toml)\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e/\"\n```\n\nIf you are using this under a subdomain (e.g. `\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz`), include the trailing `/`. **You need to do this especially if you are using GitHub!**\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz/\"\n```\n\nChange `cname` in `/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml`. Again, if you don't have a custom domain to use, you can use `\u003cYOUR-USERNAME\u003e.github.io`.\n\nPlease note that the `cname` field should *not* have any path `e.g. end with /quartz` or have a trailing `/`.\n\n[Reference `deploy.yaml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml)\n\n```yaml {title=\".github/workflows/deploy.yaml\"}\n- name: Deploy  \n  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3  \n  with:  \n\tgithub_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # this can stay as is, GitHub fills this in for us!\n\tpublish_dir: ./public  \n\tpublish_branch: master\n\tcname: \u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e\n```\n\nHave a custom domain?

[Install Hugo with \"extended\" Sass/SCSS version](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) first. Then,\n\n```bash\n# Navigate to your local Quartz folder\ncd \u003clocation-of-your-local-quartz\u003e\n\n# Start local server\nmake serve\n\n# View your site in a browser at http://localhost:1313/\n```\n\n\u003e 🌍 Step 5: [Hosting Quartz online!](notes/hosting.md)","lastmodified":"2022-11-06T04:54:24.016479644Z","tags":null},"/notes/search":{"title":"Search","content":"\nQuartz supports two modes of searching through content.\n\n## Full-text\nFull-text search is the default in Quartz. It produces results that *exactly* match the search query. This is easier to setup but usually produces lower quality matches.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# the default option\nenableSemanticSearch: false\n```\n\n## Natural Language\nNatural language search is powered by [Operand](https://operand.ai/). It understands language like a person does and finds results that best match user intent. In this sense, it is closer to how Google Search works.\n\nNatural language search tends to produce higher quality results than full-text search.\n\nHere's how to set it up.\n\n1. Create an Operand Account on [their website](https://operand.ai/).\n2. Go to Dashboard \u003e Settings \u003e Integrations.\n3. Follow the steps to setup the GitHub integration. Operand needs access to GitHub in order to index your digital garden properly!\n4. Head over to Dashboard \u003e Objects and press `(Cmd + K)` to open the omnibar and select 'Create Collection'.\n\t1. Set the 'Collection Label' to something that will help you remember it.\n\t2. You can leave the 'Parent Collection' field empty.\n5. Click into your newly made Collection.\n\t1. Press the 'share' button that looks like three dots connected by lines.\n\t2. Set the 'Interface Type' to `object-search` and click 'Create'.\n\t3. This will bring you to a new page with a search bar. Ignore this for now.\n6. Go back to Dashboard \u003e Settings \u003e API Keys and find your Quartz-specific Operand API key under 'Other keys'.\n\t1. Copy the key (which looks something like `0e733a7f-9b9c-48c6-9691-b54fa1c8b910`).\n\t2. Open `data/config.yaml`. Set `enableSemanticSearch` to `true` and `operandApiKey` to your copied key.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# the default option\nenableSemanticSearch: true\noperandApiKey: \"0e733a7f-9b9c-48c6-9691-b54fa1c8b910\"\n```\n7. Make a commit and push your changes to GitHub. See the [[notes/hosting|hosting]] page if you haven't done this already.\n\t1. This step is *required* for Operand to be able to properly index your content. \n\t2. Head over to Dashboard \u003e Objects and select the collection that you made earlier\n8. Press `(Cmd + K)` to open the omnibar again and select 'Create GitHub Repo'\n\t1. Set the 'Repository Label' to `Quartz`\n\t2. Set the 'Repository Owner' to your GitHub username\n\t3. Set the 'Repository Ref' to `master`\n\t4. Set the 'Repository Name' to the name of your repository (usually just `quartz` if you forked the repository without changing the name)\n\t5. Leave 'Root Path' and 'Root URL' empty\n9. Wait for your repository to index and enjoy natural language search in Quartz! Operand refreshes the index every 2h so all you need to do is just push to GitHub to update the contents in the search.","lastmodified":"2022-11-06T04:54:24.016479644Z","tags":null},"/notes/setup":{"title":"Setup","content":"\n## Making your own Quartz\nSetting up Quartz requires a basic understanding of `git`. If you are unfamiliar, [this resource](https://resources.nwplus.io/2-beginner/how-to-git-github.html) is a great place to start!\n\n### Forking\n\u003e A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.\n\nNavigate to the GitHub repository for the Quartz project:\n\n📁 [Quartz Repository](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz)\n\nThen, Fork the repository into your own GitHub account. If you don't have an account, you can make on for free [here](https://github.com/join). More details about forking a repo can be found on [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).\n\n### Cloning\nAfter you've made a fork of the repository, you need to download the files locally onto your machine. Ensure you have `git`, then type the following command replacing `YOUR-USERNAME` with your GitHub username.\n\n```shell\ngit clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/quartz\n```\n\n## Editing\nGreat! Now you have everything you need to start editing and growing your digital garden.

Here are a list of common questions and problems people encounter when installing Quartz.\n\nWhile you're here, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/cRFFHYye7t) :)\n\n### Does Quartz have Latex support?\nYes! See [CJK + Latex Support (测试)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(测试).md) for a brief demo.\n\n### Can I use \\\u003cObsidian Plugin\\\u003e in Quartz?\nUnless it produces direct Markdown output in the file, no. There currently is no way to bundle plugin code with Quartz.\n\nThe easiest way would be to add your own HTML partial that supports the functionality you are looking for.\n\n### My GitHub pages is just showing the README and not Quartz\nMake sure you set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`! See more in the [hosting](/notes/hosting) guide\n\n### Some of my pages have 'January 1, 0001' as the last modified date\nThis is a problem caused by `git` treating files as case-insensitive by default and some of your posts probably have capitalized file names. You can turn this off in your Quartz by running this command.\n\n```shell\n# in the root of your Quartz (same folder as config.toml)\ngit config core.ignorecase true\n\n# or globally (not recommended)\ngit config --global core.ignorecase true\n```\n\n### Can I publish only a subset of my pages?\nYes! Quartz makes selective publishing really easy. Heres a guide on [excluding pages from being published](notes/ignore%20notes.md).\n\n### Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages?\nYes! All built files can be found under `/public` in the `master` branch. More details under [hosting](notes/hosting.md).\n\n### `command not found: hugo-obsidian`\nMake sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize `hugo-obsidian` as an executable.\n\n```shell\n# Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bash_profile\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n\n# In your current terminal, to reload the session\nsource ~/.bash_profile\n```\n\n### How come my notes aren't being rendered?\nYou probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files. You can either setup [Obsidian](notes/obsidian.md) to do this for you or you need to manually define it. More details in [the 'how to edit' guide](notes/editing.md).\n\n### My custom domain isn't working!\nWalk through the steps in [the hosting guide](notes/hosting.md) again. Make sure you wait 30 min to 1 hour for changes to take effect.\n\n### How do I setup Google Analytics?\nYou can edit it in `config.toml` and either use a V3 (UA-) or V4 (G-) tag.\n\n### How do I change the content on the home page?\nTo edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.\n\n### How do I change the colours?\nYou can change the theme by editing `assets/custom.scss`. More details on customization and themeing can be found in the [customization guide](notes/config.md).\n\n### How do I add images?\nYou can put images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### My Interactive Graph and Backlinks aren't up to date\nBy default, the `linkIndex.json` (which Quartz needs to generate the Interactive Graph and Backlinks) are not regenerated locally. To set that up, see the guide on [local editing](notes/editing.md)\n\n### Can I use React/Vue/some other framework?\nNot out of the box. You could probably make it work by editing `/layouts/_default/single.html` but that's not what Quartz is designed to work with. 99% of things you are trying to do with those frameworks you can accomplish perfectly fine using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.\n\n## Still Stuck?\nQuartz isn't perfect! If you're still having troubles, file an issue in the GitHub repo with as much information as you can reasonably provide. Alternatively, you can message me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_jzhao) and I'll try to get back to you as soon as I can.\n\n🐛 [Submit an Issue](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/issues)","lastmodified":"2022-11-06T04:54:24.016479644Z","tags":null},"/notes/updating":{"title":"Updating","content":"\nHaven't updated Quartz in a while and want all the cool new optimizations?
