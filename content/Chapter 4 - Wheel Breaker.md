# Mission 4 - Detect Traps
>There was a dream in a dark place that spoke so loud a universe followed in its wake.
> 	- Sarah Zedig, “Godfeels”

## BRIEFING
Jerry’s mission statement is simple: Hell’s Gate needs a mine that’s safe for miners to enter. But from what the team has learnt, that’s probably not going to be as easy as just going to the mine and recarving some leylines.
### GOAL
Reach the mine on Boltzmann. Investigate the site. Clear it of any potential hazards. Find out what happened to PHASE//SHIFT.
### STAKES
If the Gate can’t fulfil this contract, it’s probably not going to get another one this good for a long time. Something is happening on Boltzmann, and it may continue if not stopped.
### REWARD
If the Gate delivers on this contract, there’ll be enough money to let the PCs advance to LICENSE LEVEL 4. If PHASE//SHIFT left any gear at the Boltzmann mine, the PCs can keep it.
### RESERVES
The PCs have access to any reserves they acquired from the last few missions.

## CLOCKS
The Station Stability clock will not be affected until the end of the mission.
At the start of the mission, tick a segment on the Cult Influence clock. The Cult is still at work in the shadows.

## MISSION STRUCTURE
>In contrast to the previous two missions, this one is very straightforward. The team deploy to the mine, progress downwards through its various levels, and must face three combat encounters along the way, separated by breaks long enough to rest. AUDIO LOGS AND NHPS Scattered throughout this mission are a few audio logs which the player characters can find and listen to. This is a homage to sci-fi horror games like System Shock, where players arrive to a disaster after it’s happened and have to piece together what happened through the notes its victims left. Feel free to include more if it would serve the story! Unless a player took the Technophile talent, this will likely be the first mission where players have NHPs riding along with them. Start characterizing them. How do they handle stress? How do they handle fighting? What’s their rapport with their pilot like? Make sure your players know how to deal with a cascade, and make sure you have an idea of how an NHP would act while cascading.

### PERFECT SIMULATION
The rogue NHP TRIPLE-POINT occupies a position somewhere between gang boss and deity to the Circuit. Rather than a single NHP, it was cloned from a legion, a gestalt co-consciousness entity formed by multiple NHPs to allow faster information transfer and response times during high-stakes situations like fleet battles.
The creation of “legion-forks” is prohibited by Union, because they’re essentially born in cascade and have trouble forming stable subjectivities. TRIPLE-POINT is an example of this, exhibiting megalomania, violent paranoia and a compulsion to run simulations of potential apocalypses. It holds an obsession with catastrophic disasters it believes only it can prevent.
TRIPLE-POINT got the news about the Tachyon in the same way the rest of the system did: watching it explode with Andros Capella inside of it. This surprise revealed a terrifying gap in its predictive capabilities, and so it spent the next few hours frantically breaking into every single server it could find, trying to work out how it could have missed this development.
As usual, it began running simulations of possible futures which, as usual, all resulted in the end of the world. But a broken clock is right twice a day, and for once, TRIPLE-POINT’s predictions were accurate: it was finally predicting a genuine apocalypse that would actually happen. But the only difference it could see from its perspective was that it couldn’t work out a way to prevent this one.
None of the solutions it applied to past apocalyptic scenarios worked in its projections. Of course, in reality, this was because it had only “prevented” them by merit of there being no actual danger in the first place. In its opinion, however, it had successfully prevented dozens of catastrophes. That it couldn’t find a solution to this one could clearly not be its own fault.
It responded as any rational doomsday prepper would: by sealing itself in an underground bunker and eating all of its worshippers.
Clearly, the issue was that its cultists were keeping secrets from it, or else their pathetic and disgusting meat-based forms of communication did not allow them to transmit their knowledge in a sufficiently high-fidelity format. It would be simpler to just suck the thoughts directly out of their brains.
TRIPLE-POINT had already secured a lavish apocalypse bunker from which to conduct its work: a local mining company, PHASE//SHIFT, had built it for the Circuit in return for being allowed to mine exotic materials on Boltzmann. However, this was a dangerous loose end for TRIPLE-POINT; anyone who knew about the mine had to be dealt with.
The “integration” process needed to be tested first, and the mining crew currently on shift at the facility proved convenient subjects. There were some early issues with instantaneous brain-death, but by the tenth miner, TRIPLE-POINT had refined its technique. Once it had access to the miners’ memories, it used their credentials to impersonate them.
Under the pretext of a post-accident inspection, it convinced PHASE//SHIFT’s directors to visit the mine, whereupon they were also “integrated.” Now with full access to PHASE//SHIFT’s personnel records and internal communications, TRIPLE-POINT was able to convince every single employee to travel to the mine. This neatly solved two problems: it got rid of everyone who knew about the mine, and it provided enough test subjects to allow “integration” to be perfected.
In a betrayal the Circuit probably should have seen coming, TRIPLE-POINT then “integrated” its own followers and devoured every single NHP in the Circuit’s service other than its guardian, CAUSTIC. Consuming so many NHPs caused TRIPLE-POINT to enter an even deeper stage of cascade, spilling out of its casket and undergoing a bizarre transformation.
It now exists as an Eidolon, a strange entity that may represent the “true” form of an NHP outside of a casket. It twists spacetime and the laws of reality around itself in a series of hyperspatial layers, each representing a facet of the NHP’s psyche, thoughts and personality.
Despite months of frantic simulation, all of this has gotten TRIPLE-POINT no closer to finding a solution to the impending apocalypse. It has fallen into a deep despondency, and is now trapped in a warped extrusion of its own thought, unable to find a way out.
The guardian CAUSTIC, meanwhile, has been tasked with TRIPLE-POINT’s protection. This duty has been complicated somewhat by the recent arrival of a team of Faith exorcists who became aware of the Eidolon at the base of the mine and sought to get rid of it. It’s taken to modifying the chassis it pilots, adding elements only a cascading NHP could invent.
Despite being in cascade itself, CAUSTIC suspects TRIPLE-POINT may be beyond the point of help. At this point, its attitude towards TRIPLE-POINT is similar to that of a child towards a terminally ill parent.

## Beat 20 - Graveyard Shift

Travelling to the Ruins of Boltzmann takes about three days. When the team reaches it, it’s eerily quiet.
Siren’s voice cuts across the silence. “Marines! We’re beginning final approach to the Boltzmann Mine. You should see this.”
She pulls up a illusion of the mine and its surroundings. All four of its landing bowls are occupied – and not just occupied but crowded, four to six ships to a bowl. There are corvettes, shuttles, landers, barges, freighters, even a couple of destroyers parked further out.
“Every single ship registered to PHASE//SHIFT is down there. And from what I’m seeing? That’s got to be every ship the Circuit owns, too. Maybe they have moonlighters who aren’t flying official colours, but from the intel we have, I’d call it: that’s all of them.
“I’m getting no thermal off any of them. They’re all ambient temperature. Same with the support buildings. Even if they went dark the moment they saw us coming, there’s no way everything could be this cold. Unless they set up habitation much deeper in the mine, I don’t see how anyone could still be alive down there.”
Due to the overcrowded landing bowls, the Dragon’s Tooth has to set down some distance away from the mine – a couple of kilometres, at least. The walk to the facility is silent and tense; Boltzmann is airless and the only sound the PCs can hear is the noise of their own mechs moving and any comms chatter they choose to engage in.
THE LANDING BOWLS
Every ship is silent and cold. Getting into one will require a breaching charge or a cutting tool; a mech’s melee weapon isn’t the most elegant solution, but it’ll work fine. It doesn’t matter what ship they inspect: they’re all the same. None of them were carrying much cargo, nor many personal effects. There aren’t enough supplies on any of them for an extended stay here.
Disconcertingly, each ship has had almost all of its electronic equipment removed: slates, communication devices, central mainframes. Just about anything with a microchip has been pulled out if it can be pulled out, and most of the integrated systems have been stripped as well. This would’ve been difficult, time-consuming work, and it permanently disabled these ships.
There’s something even more unsettling about the Circuit ships: each of them is supposed to have at least one NHP on board, but their core modules are vacant, their cradles sitting empty. There’s no sign of any forced entry (or exit, for those who recall the Tachyon). The modules were opened by people who were authorised to do so, and the caskets were extracted.
As the team gets close to the mine itself, they pass by one particular ship, and Siren notices something odd:
“Wait. Something’s different about that ship, right there. It isn’t registered to PHASE//SHIFT, but it’s an IPS-N Trout – those don’t have an NHP module. The Circuit wouldn’t use it. It’s cold, but it’s not covered in as much dust as the rest of the ships in that bowl. It set down more recently.”
The ship turns out to be the ISV Promised Fulfilment. From the firebird motifs painted on the hull, it obviously belongs to the Faith of the One.
It’s possible the PCs might think to call Ignatius about this. He informs them the Promised Fulfilment was on Boltzmann to perform “a cleansing;” he claims that the mine has “become the nexus of a profane ritual whose exact nature we cannot divine.” A “Lightcaster,” Annabelle McKenzie, was put in charge of undoing it. She hasn’t been heard from since shortly after she arrived at the mine, and Ignatius fears the worst. He cautions the team to be careful.
THE FACILITY
The team will have to hop out of their mechs to explore the facility’s buildings. They won’t fit inside anything other than the mech bay, which is currently sealed shut from the inside anyway.
The buildings have been stripped of electronic equipment just like the ships. There are still personal effects in the living quarters and barracks, suggesting that PHASE//SHIFT’s mining crews didn’t leave. The base hasn’t received a resupply on its provisions for months, but it hasn’t needed it; there’s been nobody here to eat them.
Occasionally, there’ll be a repeating phrase written on a note or scrawled on a wall:
WHAT WILL BE WILL ALWAYS BE WHAT WILL BE MUST NOT BE

The facility’s entire compliment of civilian loading and mining chassis are missing. Their locational transponders were either turned off or are somewhere beyond the range of the Dragon’s Tooth’s sensors.
A base camp has recently been erected in one of the warehouses. There’s the standard stuff: portable generators, pressurized tents, air recyclers, along with provisions, medical supplies, and various personal effects. But there’s also some stranger items: incense, robes, paper talismans inscribed with prayers, the religious texts of various faiths, and the entire camp is surrounded by a circle that seems to have been burnt into the floor and sprinkled with gold dust. This camp was made by followers of the Faith of the One; but they aren’t here, and haven’t been in a while.
A slate lies in one of the tents. It’s neither encrypted nor password-protected, indicating that whoever owned it – one “Lightcaster Annabelle McKenzie,” – had a lot of trust in whomever she shared space with. On the slate is a message from Ignatius Aurum: AUDIO LOG: I. AURUM, HIGH PRIEST “PRAY CAUTION” “Lightcaster McKenz–… forget the solemnity for a moment. Annabelle. I chose you to lead this mission because I trust you, but I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t worried. Let’s be clear: this mission is dangerous, and if it goes wrong, rescue won’t be coming. A vile sorcery lies upon the mine that prevents even Her sight from penetrating its depths. If you fail, I won’t send any more teams; I can’t risk it. “Please, be careful. I know we’ll meet in the Next World, Aster, but I’d really like to see you again in this one. May Her flame light your way.”
One tent has been laid out as a command center of sorts – there are detailed plans of the facility, on which various spots have been marked. There are annotations, some of which are obvious.
About a third of the way down the primary shaft, a blockage is marked, and there’s a secondary tunnel at a similar depth labelled “possible breach point?”
Some are more difficult to comprehend: timestamps, spatial co-ordinates, and arcane glyphs. It looks like whoever camped here made several expeditions into the mine, compiling these notes gradually.
A few specific things haven’t been stripped: the reactors and power distribution systems are still intact, along with the mine’s transport infrastructure – trains, winches, conveyors, elevators, and so on. Moreover, their usage records are accessible.
Prior to going dark, the transport systems were used a great deal – a large amount of rock was removed, but no useful material came up with it. Later, a large amount of heavy equipment was moved into the mine. Shortly after that, the personnel elevators started running non-stop for almost a day.
ENTERING THE MINE
The reactors can easily be restarted and the transport systems powered up again, allowing ingress to the mine via the primary freight elevator.
With the power restored, the upper tunnels are lit, but they’re all just as empty as the facility above. Mining equipment has been stripped of its electronic components and left scattered.
At about a third of the mine’s total depth, the mineshaft is blocked off entirely. The transit track has been disconnected and the shaft is sealed by what appears to be a mixture of rock and metal crudely melted into a plug several meters thick. The plug is opaque to even the strongest sensors, although they can detect a faint reverberation being conducted through it from beneath.
With most of the facility’s mining equipment missing or inoperable, the plug can’t be breached; none of the team’s mechs have the tools to dig through something this thick in a timely fashion.
There’s a local signal beacon near the plug – a slate, with an audio log on it: 

AUDIO LOG: D. MARIANO, INITIATE “PLUG” 
Alright, I’m leaving this here so that the rest of you stop trying to dig through this thing. It’s mostly tungsten with a bunch of silicate rock muddled in, about eight metres thick. There’s no major seams; whatever process they used to make this thing fused it to the walls pretty firmly. We’re not getting through with the tools we have. Yes, Clarence, this means you. Your thermal lance is not a mining tool. Good job making a hole! It’s barely the width of an arm and half a metre deep! Another six years and we’ll be able to get a child through this thing! Great work! Now do your real job and find a way around, or I’m telling Annabelle.

SOMETHING WRONG
Carved into rock at various places in the upper tunnels is the repeating phrase, once again:
WHAT WILL BE WILL ALWAYS BE WHAT WILL BE MUST NOT BE
The tunnel lights are unreliable. Sometimes they flicker, and in the momentary darkness, a PC sees something; a brief glimpse, not long enough to make out properly.
A PC gets a shiver down their spine, the inexplicable certainty that something else is in the cockpit with them. But when they look, there’s nothing there. The feeling is gone. They are alone.
In the distance, at the end of the tunnel, there’s a flicker of movement, a vaguely humanoid shape. It’s gone by the time the PCs get there, leaving no trace that it was ever there at all.
Every so often, there are sets of markings on the walls – a date, a time and a spatial co-ordinate. The dates and times are all months old, but the spatial co-ordinates all conform to the locations of the markings.
However, there are some areas of the upper tunnels – matching the curious annotations on the map – that are marked out with thick lines.
If a PC steps inside one of these areas, nothing happens at first. However, if they remain in the zone for any length of time, their mech’s sensors begin to glitch. Faint false readings appear, neither visible to those outside the zone or consistent between those within it. The PCs are struck with a sense of incredible déjà vu, of having experienced this before.
THE WAY FORWARD
If the team consults the map of the mine the Faith left behind, there’s a tunnel marked as “possible breach point” that’s accessible from above the plug, and it nearly intersects another tunnel that leads to the area below the plug. They can also discover this themselves if they consult another map of the tunnel network, or if they just explore the tunnels.
Clearly the Faith had the same idea, since there’s a breach into the other tunnel that looks like it was made using the facility’s remaining mining equipment. The breach has been sealed with metal-silicate in a similar manner to the primary elevator shaft, but ground-penetrating sonar reveals that the plug’s not very thick and another breach could be made behind it, further into the tunnel.
It will take some time to scrounge up the necessary tools and equipment; drills, explosives, structural supports, and so on, but there’s more than enough of it lying around to open the tunnel up again.
Lying near the original breach is another audio log: AUDIO LOG: A. MCKENZIE, LIGHTCASTER “BEWARE” As a hedge against our possible failure, I’m leaving this log. If someone else stumbles across this, that means we failed in our task. Turn away. Seal up this place and never return. For the record, my name is Annabelle McKenzie, of the Faith of the One Plumed In Golden Flame. I am a Lightcaster, we who banish shadows and bring light to dark places. A foul and unnatural presence has taken root in this mine and my cohort and I will remove it, or die trying. The Circuit, a technocult in league with HORUS, are conducting a profane ritual at the base of this mine and somehow convinced everyone who knew about this place to join them. We don’t know the precise nature of the ritual, but it has distorted spacetime around a central nexus at the base of the mine. We aim to penetrate to that level and stop it. If you’re listening to this, we failed. Turn away. Seal up this place and never return.

BEAT 21: MINE’S HAUNTED
The team breaches the inner mine.
Past the breach, the tunnel continues. For a couple of minutes, you simply walk, nothing beyond the breach appearing very different to what came before.
Then you hear it: a deep, slow, gong-like reverberation that rolls up through your mech’s feet and into your cockpit. Your chest tightens, your breath quickens, and you feel the whisper of your lizard brain telling you something is very, very wrong.
Echo imaging reveals a large chamber ahead, directly underneath the plug, with several passages leading off in various directions. The center of the cavern is occupied by a large, spire-like structure that sits where the elevator track should be.
Then you see it: between two echo bursts, a small blip at the opening to one of the tunnels. Something was there in the first image, and gone in the next.
The central chamber is a chaotic mess: giant cable bundles spill from almost every tunnel. Mining and construction equipment is strewn everywhere. Scaffolds built into the walls hold auxiliary power supplies, portable reactors, or server equipment.
The structure at the center of the chamber seems to be built using the elevator track as a spine. It’s a nightmare of cobbled-together electronics and NHP caskets, still operational. If the team gets close enough, they can see something far more sinister: there are hundreds of hardsuits rigged into it. None of them display life signs.
Checking ident tags on the hardsuits confirms the presence of nearly every member of PHASE//SHIFT and several known members of the Circuit. They’re all dead, and have been for months at least. There are also hardsuits belonging to members of the Faith of the One, but they’ve only been dead a month or so.
The team is definitely not alone down here. There are constant movement pings in the deep tunnels, but they’re much more extensive, don’t appear on any of the maps available to the PCs and seem to stretch for kilometers; it would take days to search them all.
Approaching the Spire too closely, charging weapons or spooling up offensive systems will trigger a hostile response. The movement blips in the tunnels will rapidly approach, but will back off again if the PCs cease the offending activity.
The reverberation becomes louder and more pervasive the closer the team approach to the spire, and seems to be emanating from directly underneath it. This isn’t necessarily something the PCs can confirm with sensors or rational reasoning; they just feel it to be true.
A patch of the floor close to the spire has been sealed up in the same way as the roof has – a dense plug of tungsten and silicate rock. It’s surrounded by wrecked mechs that have the same paint job as the ones the team fought on the Icebreaker; these must have belonged to the Faith’s exorcists. None of these wrecks have corpses inside; presumably they’re the dead Faith members rigged up to the spire. Notably, there’s one less corpse than there are mechs.
The other wrecks bear the colors of the Circuit, and do have corpses inside, but even a casual examination will reveal they couldn’t have died in the fight. They’ve been dead far too long, and they have no signs of physical trauma; from the looks of things, they perished from thirst and starvation several months ago.
It looks like the Faith were using one of the mine’s drilling rigs to bore the hole in the floor that was later patched up. The rig they used has been smashed to pieces, but several other intact ones are lying about, if the PCs want to descend further into the mine. The problem is that they can’t do it in the same place; they’ll have to find a new location to bore through the floor.
This will necessitate getting close to the Spire, triggering its threat response.
The mechs that the Spire sends against the team are unsettling monstrosities. They look like Circuit mechs, and their transponders still display the callsigns of known Circuit pilots, but they’ve been changed in a horrible, unnatural fashion. There are bizarre crystalline growths jutting from their hulls, and their comms feeds spit out stuttering, looping fragments of transmissions their pilots made in the past.
Scans reveal there are human bodies inside the mechs, but no life signs. Attempting to talk to the pilots provokes an unpleasant response: the voices on the other end of the line sound almost human, but don’t reply in the correct context – for instance, they might respond to a demand to power down weapons as if they were ordering a coffee, or saying goodnight to a child.

DETAILS
THE BATTLEFIELD
The spire is at least a Size 5 obstruction (Size 5 objects occupy the same area as f2, in case you need a reference) that extends floor to ceiling and completely blocks line of sight.
It’s too large, solid and complex to be meaningfully damaged by the PCs, but trying to do so will trigger an immediate defensive response. Any PC who deals damage to the spire must make an AGILITY save against a target of 12, or take 3j. Hostile NPCs treat the spire like an Escort or Extraction sitrep objective; they will never willingly damage it.
There is ample Size 1 and Size 2 cover, mostly construction equipment, stockpiled parts, mining rubble or wrecked mechs.
THE FIGHT
The PCs must locate the optimal location around the spire to place the drilling rig. Their mechs each have sensor suites adequate to calculate four possible points that might work, but they’ll need to be placed on a spot to confirm if it’s the optimal one.
The SPECTER is a horrifying new enemy that likes to isolate characters and tear them to pieces. Because it’s permanently INVISIBLE, it can easily become HIDDEN to prevent reprisals and reposition itself. Its HUNT trait will force PCs to choose between bunching up to mitigate its damage, or spreading out to scout the control zones.
The WITCH’s PETRIFY ability is devastating, and can be frustrating to players who suffer under it. Make sure they know that removing a condition via STABILIZE won’t remove the PETRIFY effect that causes a progression to the next condition, but SHUT DOWN will.
OUTCOME
PC DEFEAT
If the PCs can’t secure the true control zone by the end of the sixth round, the spire summons additional reinforcements. The team must make a choice: retreat and try again later, or immediately move to Combat: Countdown (p. 182) without the opportunity to rest.
PC VICTORY
If the PCs secure the true control zone, they have identified the optimal point to deploy the drilling rig. They may retreat, rest and patch up their mechs, returning to the spire at their leisure.
Once the team triggers the drilling rig, the spire recognizes this as a direct assault and begins summoning every available combat unit it has. Move to Combat: Countdown (p. 182).

DETAILS
THE BATTLEFIELD
If the team succeeded during Combat: Pressure Point, his fight takes place in the same location that they secured. Before the fight begins, they may rearrange any and all pieces of Size 1 and Size 2 cover (including destroyed mechs from the previous fight) as they see fit to create barricades, kill zones or other obstructions. If the team didn’t succeed, they’re going to have to dig with the battlefield as it is.
The Spire is still present. As before, any PC who deals damage to it must make an AGILITY save against a target of 12, or take 3j. Hostile NPCs treat the spire like an Escort or Extraction sitrep objective; they will never willingly damage it.
THE FIGHT
The team must buy time for the drilling rig to bore through the floor. The rig is a Size 3 object that provides hard cover, blocks line of sight and is too sturdy for enemies to damage. If you need to, expand the size of the objective zone so PCs can still maneuver.
The LOBBER is another new enemy type that deals close-range area damage. Use it to harass players that bunch up. These Lobbers have EXPERT DEMOLITIONIST, allowing them to rapidly destroy cover.
OUTCOME
PC DEFEAT
If the PCs can’t maintain control of the drilling rig, the spire’s defence forces smash it to pieces. The PCs must retreat, regroup and find another drilling rig. They may rest and come back to fight any remaining mechs or reinforcements as a standard battle.
PC VICTORY
If the PCs maintain control of the drilling rig, they’re able to drill a hole through the floor into what should be the lowest third of the mining complex. But what it breaches into doesn’t look like mine tunnels.
As the drilling rig retracts, something resembling light spills out of the hole, but it hurts to look at. Your sensor readouts writhe and shriek in protest, trying to approximate what precisely it is. It pulses in time with the reverberation.
Mech sensors eventually identify the entity through the hole as an abnormal space; some sort of metafold. The spire appears to be acting as some kind of stabilization unit. Destroying the spire won’t destroy the metafold; it’s being generated from inside. Destroying the spire will destabilize it, however, creating a harmonic chain reaction whose endpoint cannot be calculated. They’ll need to shut it down from within. There’s time for a rest before they proceed.

BEAT 22: THE HALL OF MIRRORS
The team descends into the metafold.
The simulation of possible timelines has become reflexive, and it now does so unconsciously to anyone who sets foot in its Eidolon. It will confront the team with visions of themselves.
Tell your players you’re going to ask them questions periodically, and they need to write down an answer on behalf of their characters without thinking too much; the first thing that pops into their head. These answers needn’t be too detailed; just a couple of words is fine.
Once all the players have written their answers, have each of them read theirs aloud, and then explain it a little. They can be as poetic or as direct as they want; let them get creative, but don’t force it out of them.
The things each player character sees in the Mirrors are known only to them, unless they choose to share them with each other. Make a note of their answers; they might be important later.
THE OUTER MYRIAD
The tunnels are no longer made of rock and it’s no longer dark, though to say that there’s light also feels inaccurate. There’s color and shape but the colors don’t quite conform to the spectrum you’re familiar with and the shapes don’t quite seem to be things that can exist in three-dimensional space.
The corridor you walk through is all sharp angles, made of some transparent and slightly reflective material. When your mech’s feet tread upon it you hear it cracking and splintering, but when you look down, the surface isn’t even scratched. Beyond the glass is a whiteness that is somehow dark, filled with indistinct, swarming silhouettes in the far distance.
The deep bass thrumming is gone – no, that’s not quite right. You can’t hear it anymore, not consciously, but you know it’s still there, far below your range of hearing.
This is the outermost layer of TRIPLE-POINT’s Eidolon, a reservoir containing what remains of all the human and NHP subjectivities it has consumed. Because it’s constructed mostly from digested human subjectivity, the basic rules of reality operate roughly how a human expects them to – but not how they actually should, which causes some confusion with their mech’s sensors and motive systems.
NHPs installed in the team’s mechs report wildly differing experiences, both to the PCs and each other. OSIRIS-class NHPs will describe the environment as a “metacreative extraspace” but will struggle to define what exactly that means. DIDYMOS-class NHPs will report causality as “unusually thin” in this location. ATHENA-class NHPs will note that this space is “non-computable” – they cannot create a Simulacra of it.
SISYPHUS-class NHPs, particularly Millstone, will express severe discomfort, remarking that they “can’t remember ever being here.” In what appears to be a state of confusion, they’ll discuss aspects of what’s happening now as if it occurred in the distant past.
The team isn’t quite alone here; most of the subjectivities present here are too formless and oblivious to interact with the PCs, or even realise that they’re there. But some are still whole enough to speak.
It comes as whispering through comms channels, barely audible above the static. They can’t cause any actual harm, but they can torment and insinuate. They’ll prey on suspicions, enflame tensions between PCs, plant thoughts of betrayal or deception. They’ll whisper falsehoods about people the PCs trust – and they might mix in a few truths as well. For example:
“Ipswich DeLacey isn’t who they say they are. What are they hiding from you?”
“The anxiety is a front. Jerry knows more than he lets on, and he’s not sharing it with you.”
“Cerulean calls you a friend but he’d sell you out in a heartbeat if his own skin was on the line.”
“Those tally marks on her casket aren’t cascades. They’re airmen who died with her as their co-pilot.”
They’ll whisper things about the PCs’ pasts, present or future, bringing up events or characters from their backstories that nobody else should know about.
“Harrison Armory is coming for you. You’re putting all your friends in danger just by being here.”
“You think if you save enough lives, you’ll find Zohana, but she’s gone. You’ll never see her again.”
“Doesn’t it just eat you up inside? How Susa stole your life’s work and made you a laughing stock?”

They’ll also bring these things up to other PCs.
“If Seraph really trusts you, why have they never told you about the missing voice?”
“Ask Eyes where he was three years ago.”
“Scale came to Calliope to murder someone. Don’t you think you have a right to know who?”
After the PCs have all had some unhappy things said to them, they come across a corridor with a large hole in its roof that’s been patched with the same kind of tungsten-silicate plug they’ve seen before; this is the other side of the hole that the Faith’s team dug. If the PCs search the surrounding area, there’s another audio log lying on the floor of a side corridor. AUDIO LOG: A. MCKENZIE, LIGHTCASTER “TESTAMENT” All of the others are dead. Or worse. They came at us, out of the shadows. They looked like the Circuit’s mechs, but they… they didn’t move like they had humans inside. We gave as good as we got, took a dozen of them down, but for every one of them we killed, there were another two. The moment the hole was open, Clarence pushed me into it. Said he’d be right after me, that he had to go back for Dinah. I just ran. I don’t even know who I’m recording this for. If you’re hearing this, you’re as fucked as I am. But I’m going to look upon the core of this thing, I swear, if it’s the last thing I do. By the way, don’t listen to the voices.
Leading away from the hole are a series of gouges in the walls of the corridor, spaced about every ten meters or so, as if someone dug the tip of a sharp object into the glass and dragged it downward. They seem to be marking passage deeper into the complex.
This strange tangle of glass corridors finally ends, giving way to an opening leading to a vast expanse of utter darkness, from which the “light” in the corridor illuminates only a small area of icy lunar surface.
As they leave, ask the first question:
In this Mirror is reflected the person you think you are. What do you see?
THE CRYPT OF STARS
You stand on a barren plain of ice, strewn with wreckage, its darkness dispelled only by your mech’s floodlamps. Even the distant stars do not pierce the gloom. Nothing moves here, nor has moved for a very long time, if anything here ever moved at all.
You look into the sky, and there is still somehow a memory of light: an awful glare that scorched this desolate place black in an instant. But at its core, though many billions of kilometers away, you see it: a horrible un-light, a singular point of darkness beyond dark, a thing that swallows endlessly.
Elsewhere in the sky, there looms a black circle where no star is visible. It had a name once, given by a human tongue in a time long past: this was Chameleon, the most distant of Calliope’s children. It alone has survived, bearing silent witness to the death of its brothers and sisters, torn to shreds and consumed in their mother’s death throes.
The ground trembles at your footfalls, and a voice from beneath wails out:
BEHOLD THE CRYPT OF STARS
In the sky above, one by one, you see it: darkness falling as one by one, the stars wink out. There is only one sound: a deep, bass reverberation, below your range of hearing and yet somehow still audible, that now carries with it twelve words:
WHAT WILL BE WILL ALWAYS BE WHAT WILL BE MUST NOT BE
This is the largest layer of TRIPLE-POINT’s Eidolon, the apocalyptic vision that it received and has endlessly ruminated upon and that it has lost all hope of avoiding.
Journeying across this awful, desolate place, the PCs find the remains of things they recognize. A hab ring from Hell’s Gate, half-buried, forming a great, forlorn arch. One of the modules from the Icebreaker, its bright neon facades dim and silent. The dome of Furnace City, skeletal, its glass shattered.
There are mechs, in great numbers. Here is Zinfandel DeJean’s Drake, its huge assault cannon torn clean off. There is Jerry Masters’ old Sherman Mk. I, lying face-down in the ice, its hatch open. Here, a Hell Hound chassis; there, a mech belonging to the Burning Forge.
Here, a Harrison Armory Saladin, its pauldrons still gleaming, and there an SSC Mourning Cloak, the tattered remnants of its cape still fluttering gently in the wake of the team’s passing.

And everywhere, bodies. Friends, relatives, loved ones, rivals, enemies; the plain is choked with corpses.
Here’s Jerry Masters, only a few meters from his mech, a short trail of footprints leading to his corpse. There’s Zinfandel DeJean, still in their Drake’s cockpit, body mummified by vacuum and cold. Here’s Striga von Aldenberg, eyes wide open, lips parted to speak some final hypothesis. There’s Ratio Salvager, somehow dead twice, his two corpses lying beside one another, their faces set in sneers of cold hatred.
There are bodies the PCs don’t recognize, too: here’s two men, each the other’s mirror image, dead ten paces from one another, guns still in their hands. There’s a bald, dark-skinned man in the uniform of Harrison Armory’s naval admiralty, hands still locked around the throat of a sneering scientist he was strangling, even as that man choked the life out of him in turn.
Eventually, the silhouette of a massive starship of Diasporan design becomes visible in the far distance, shattered on the surface of this moon. On its hull, barely legible, is written “Flagship” and “Kingdom Aniline.”
Notably, as much as the PCs might look for them, they can’t find any evidence of their own mechs or corpses anywhere in this place. The Dragon’s Tooth is also notable in its absence. In fact, this place does not seem to remember them at all; the footprints their mechs leave seem to vanish only moments later.
Everywhere, there echoes that reverberation, carrying its repeating litany:
WHAT WILL BE WILL ALWAYS BE WHAT WILL BE MUST NOT BE
The PCs journey through this hopeless place for what seems like days, seeing all the things they love and hate laid to ruin. Eventually, they find a doorway similar to the one they arrived through, but not before they get one last, fleeting vision:
Just before you pass through the doorway, you see it in the sky as the last star falls cold and dim. There is light from only one thing: a flurry of far-distant wings, blazing with firelight.
As they leave, ask the second question:
In this Mirror is reflected the person you fear you could become. What do you see?
VORSEHUNGMOTOR
You step from the wasteland into what looks very much like the hab block corridor outside your room on Hell’s Gate. For a moment, you can’t quite tell whether your mech is now human-sized, or whether everything around you is now mech-sized, until you realize you’re no longer in your mech at all.
There’s a date on a nearby screen: it’s a few months ago, although with all that’s happened since then it feels like a lifetime. You remember this day: this is the day Jerry called a general meeting of the militia and asked for volunteers to form the strategic response team. This is the day you stepped forward.
So where are you? The door you just stepped out of is your room door, but the name on it isn’t yours. Other doors open, revealing other members of the militia, some of whom you recognize and others you don’t. Some are people you know, but who aren’t in the militia. Some are complete strangers. None of them seem to pay the slightest bit of attention to you.
This area is the remains of a vast series of simulations TRIPLE-POINT ran to try and find a timeline that avoids the foreseen doom, by altering initial conditions. There are tens of millions of these what-if scenarios, but because TRIPLE-POINT hasn’t yet worked out the PCs aren’t part of its own mind, it’s instinctively placing them into simulations of events that included them.
The team may explore this strange place for a while. It’s not impossible to get the attention of the other militia members, but conversation with them is a baffling experience. Some don’t seem to recognize the PCs, or treat them in ways that are alien. A rival eagerly greets a PC as a friend, or a friend refers to a PC in some other context, addressing them as a technician or a medic rather than a fellow pilot. They refer to events that never happened, or that happened differently.
The world feels oddly truncated. Everything outside of the route to the muster grounds is out-of-focus. The rest of the aft hab ring is blurry and almost static, as if it’s merely the backdrop of a play. The PCs can’t really venture very far off the path; the world outside of it simply doesn’t exist in any real way. This was to save on processor power; it reduced fidelity, but it allowed more simulations to be run at once.
During the meeting, even if the PCs try to volunteer, Jerry will ignore them, always picking the NPCs that are “supposed” to be picked in this timeline. However, if they make a big show of volunteering, or being upset that Jerry didn’t pick them, Jerry will “glitch.” He starts repeating himself and giving answers that don’t sound Jerry-like; that he’s made a decision, that it's final, and that the PCs will just have to deal with it.

Once Jerry’s meeting is over, the room freezes; the simulation is now examining a different event at which the PCs cannot be present at because they’re not part of the team in this timeline. When the PCs leave, they find themselves back in the hab corridor, in a new simulation, with a different variable. Once again, different people are there, and those who should be known to the PCs are different in a different set of ways.
This layer has a weakness: because each simulation is a self-contained alteration of a few specific variables, it has no way of dealing with unrelated deviations. If the PCs go “off-script” by causing chaos on the station, setting off alarms, assaulting militia members or saying mean things to Jerry, the simulation will awkwardly try to pretend it didn’t happen, but it can only do so much.
To get past this layer of TRIPLE-POINT’s Eidolon, the PCs must either force the simulation to conform to the day the way they remember it, or break the flow of events so drastically the simulation has no logical way to continue. Doing so will lead to the simulation freezing, abruptly losing texture and geometric fidelity, and finally slowly derezzing into wireframe.
As this happens, ask the third question:
In this Mirror is reflected the person you could have been. What do you see?
EVENT.[NULL]
The wireframe walls of Hell’s Gate are no longer solid; you can walk straight through them into what lies behind. It’s difficult to describe in words what this place truly looks like, but your mind forces it to resolve into something that looks like the backstage area of a theatre.
Your mechs are here, just off-stage, as if waiting for their cue. As far as you can tell, they’re in exactly the same condition as they were when you left them.
Sitting nearby is a whiteboard the size of a galactic supercluster that fits neatly into the palm of your hand. On it is written a maddeningly complex story, exhaustive in every detail.
The whiteboard explains the problem this bizarre madhouse was created to solve. At one end is an event from three years ago: a small sensor blip in the outer system. In the middle is a nigh-infinite number of possible timelines. At the end, they all collapse back into a singular point: the end of all things the PCs saw in the Crypt of Stars.
The number of possible timelines in the middle keeps expanding by dozens every minute, as TRIPLE-POINT continually simulates and discards them.
Any PC who investigates this map of events will notice that there are large gaps in its awareness. It seems to take as a given that it’s informationally complete, with perfect and unrestricted access to all the data it would need to accurately simulate the whole of Calliope.
This is clearly not true. For example, TRIPLE-POINT has a frankly worrying level of access to the team’s private communications, journals and omninet data, and might even know secret identities or contacts if they have them, but it doesn’t know anything about them that isn’t written down somewhere. Any secret they keep only in their own heads is unknown to TRIPLE-POINT, and thus can’t factor in its simulations.
The simulation history tells a story of its own. TRIPLE-POINT has been simulating apocalyptic scenarios and their solutions for decades. None of these predicted apocalypses seem to have anything to do with reality. It didn’t “solve” them; there was never any danger.
TRIPLE-POINT was caught totally by surprise when the Tachyon exploded, and began frantically trying to reconstruct the sequence of events. At this point, it received the apocalyptic vision it’s currently obsessed with, but there was a twist: for the first time in its life, it couldn’t see a solution to the problem.
Its simulations became more and more desperate, attempting to find a solution to this problem. Simulation density increased in rapid, irregular bursts that seem to represent massive infusions of new data, coinciding with the disappearances of PHASE//SHIFT personnel.
It has been isolated at the bottom of this shaft for months, running millions of simulations every day, hoping to find one that holds the answer to how it can save Calliope from annihilation. At first it was trying a wealth of ideas, but at this point it seems to be looping through old simulations over and over, repeatedly asking the same question in the vain hope of getting a different answer.
Notably, none of its simulations ever involve any form of information sharing, or asking anyone for help. All of the simulations must, as a prerequisite, include itself as the main actor in averting the coming catastrophe. After all, in all the previous apocalypses, it was the one who saved everything. How could it trust anyone else?
Once they’ve examined the whiteboard, there’s not much left for them to do around here except get into their mechs and exit through the backstage door.
Ask the fourth and final question:
In this Mirror is reflected the person you wish you were. What do you see?

THE FINAL REFLECTION
The backstage door leads to a strange place of sharp angles and bright colors. Every surface seems to be polished glass, perfectly transparent and perfectly reflective at the same time.
You see yourself and your squadmates reflected, even through the reflections of your chassis: as you think you are, as you fear you could become, as you could have been, as you wish you were.
The deep, reverberating litany echoes even from the mouths of the things you see in the reflections.
WHAT WILL BE WILL ALWAYS BE WHAT WILL BE MUST NOT BE
WHAT WILL BE WILL ALWAYS BE WHAT WILL BE MUST NOT BE
WHAT WILL BE WILL ALWAYS BE WHAT WILL BE MUST NOT BE
But then, all of a sudden, there is a change.
WHAT WILL BE IS YET UNWRITTEN WHAT WILL BE MIGHT STILL NOT BE
A different voice cries out, dripping with rage.
WHAT
WHO ARE YOU
HOW DID YOU GET HERE
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE
One after another, each reflection erupts into a mass of scything, threshing mechanical limbs wielding impossible weapons and a head that, despite being mounted on a mech, is hauntingly human-like. Its face is distorted in a rictus of violent rage.
A SCYLLA-class NHP will cry out one word: “brother?!” A DIDYMOS-class NHP will begin screaming in terror, exclaiming that it can see “so many at once!” Any other NHP will simply note – likely with rising panic – that this newcomer is obviously cascading, and that the frame it’s piloting does not match any known database profile.

DETAILS
THE BATTLEFIELD
This battle takes place deep within TRIPLE-POINT’s Eidolon, although CAUSTIC’s need for a reasonably comprehensible battlefield has stabilised it somewhat.
There is ample Size 1, Size 2 and Size 3 cover. Everything on this battlefield is made of solid glass, but it’s inconsistent; sometimes it’s transparent, sometimes it reflects the battlefield, and sometimes it shows the same reflections that the PCs saw earlier.
Lightcaster Annabelle McKenzie is present, observing the engagement from her prison in a nearby tower of glass. She’s able to yell warnings to the team, but she’s delirious, so her speech might not make sense. She keeps screaming about how “it was all lies,” how there’s “no place of safety left” and how she’s been “stuck in Leviathan’s den only to hear it speaking the truth.”
THE FIGHT
CAUSTIC is a PARALLEL, an incomprehensible new enemy that exists in a superposition, partially spread across multiple timelines. Originally installed into a Gorgon pattern-group chassis, CAUSTIC has modified the frame and its systems so much as to be almost unrecognizable.
Think of the PARALLEL as an OVERWATCH specialist that can be in two places at once. Every time it teleports – which it can do either via its standard movement or by being moved via the MIRAGE, it leaves behind an echo that still projects Threat as if it were a character. The Parallel’s ACHRONAL RESPONSE reaction allows it to OVERWATCH against a character who moves within an echo’s Threat by teleporting to it.
Remember that as an ULTRA, CAUSTIC recovers its reactions every turn. This makes it very dangerous.
The MIRAGE’s False Idols look like the reflections the PCs have been seeing on their journey through the Eidolon. If it teleports an ally to them, the PCs witness a horrifying vision of their own face and body twisting into a mech as it appears in the space.
When the RONIN‘s ECHO EDGE inflicts its mark, the PC begins repeating TRIPLE-POINT’s new litany:
WHAT WILL BE IS YET UNWRITTEN WHAT WILL BE MIGHT STILL NOT BE
CAUSTIC and its minions fight with a palpable sense of desperation. It doesn’t feel like they’re just protecting TRIPLE-POINT from the PCs; it feels almost as if they’re trying to protect the PCs from something in turn. If a PC is particularly perceptive, it feels as if CAUSTIC is ashamed of something.

OUTCOME
PC DEFEAT
The PCs are… fine? They awaken at a point in time that is, according to any chronometers they care to check, well before any of the fighting that just took place. The mine is absolutely dead; no heat signatures, no paracausal echoes, nothing. In fact, there’s no indication that anything was ever here at all. Not just the cascading NHPs or the corpses of the cultists that worshipped them, but the minerals the client hoped to find. Annabelle McKenzie is nowhere to be found. This whole dig is a bust. There’s nothing here.
Pilots and their NHPs remember what transpired here, but their mechs have no corresponding footage or recordings to substantiate it. A DIDYMOS- or SISYPHUS-class NHP might be able to deduce that a non-linear time shift has occurred, but there’s no way to prove it. However, if a PC has Millstone, he can identify it with certainty.
Jerry, curiously enough, will take the PCs at their word. He doesn’t seem at all surprised by their account: in fact, he says he’s “encountered something like that before,” without elaborating further. He’s just glad that they came back in one piece.
Unfortunately, this still leaves Hell’s Gate with a dead mine and no materials for their client. Untick a segment on the Station Stability clock, as the mining teams are forced to redeploy to other parts of the system and work double shifts just to fulfil the contract.
PC VICTORY
The PCs have defeated CAUSTIC, and can rescue Annabelle McKenzie from her prison at their leisure. She’s delirious from malnourishment and trauma, and is unable to fully trust that the team aren’t just another interrogation tactic dreamed up by TRIPLE-POINT or CAUSTIC. She lashes out at them verbally, but she isn’t a threat; she needs medical help.
A successful Patch check can get Annabelle properly hydrated; this is basic first aid, and can be attempted even by PCs who don’t have ranks in the skill. If the PCs have Extra Rations or the Soup (p. 150) they don’t need to make this check. Success restores her vitality enough to hold a meaningful conversation with. If the PCs can’t treat her, they’ll simply need to bring her with them while she’s still rambling.
Whether or not she’s lucid, she keeps darkly muttering a name: “Feather.”
Annabelle isn’t certain how long she’s been stuck here; it felt like years. TRIPLE-POINT and CAUSTIC took turns interrogating her, employing tactics that ranged from the mundane to the paracausal. The only reason she doesn’t think the PCs are another illusion is that they’re showing her compassion. She doubts either NHP was capable of expressing it.
She vaguely recognizes the PCs as the team who foiled the Cult on the Icebreaker Borealis. Though she wasn’t there in person, she apologizes all the same; she says it was all for nothing in the end. She’s been worshipping a false god. Feather isn’t the One Plumed in Golden Flame. She’s just an impostor, dressed in stolen glory.
If the PCs enquire further, she says she’ll answer all their questions once they’re safely out of this hellhole. For now, she insists, they’ve got to “cut out the filthy heart of this place.”
In any case, the way is now open for the PCs to approach TRIPLE-POINT’s inner sanctum.

THE CORE
The golden sphere of TRIPLE-POINT’s casket has been splayed open like a dissected frog, delicately separated into millions of tessellating triangular shards. Each one has been blown up to several times its original size and placed into a maddeningly complex series of orbits.
At the center of this otherworldly throne sits an entity that defies all rational explanation. There are three of it, but only one. A singular triad in the form of a crystalline polyhedron with only three sides, a mathematically impossible shape.
It mutters to itself ceaselessly. The muttering is the sound of everything you’ve ever heard, arranged in a very specific pattern so as to convey meaning.
You should not see this.
The inner surfaces of the floating casket shards act like viewscreens, allowing the NHP to view the results of its millions of simulations. The PCs can see millions of possible futures, all ending in the same catastrophe they witnessed in the Crypt of Stars. The reflections of themselves that the PCs have been seeing throughout the metavault are also visible; initially, it’s only on a few screens, but as they get closer and stay longer in the room, it spreads to more and more of them.
TRIPLE-POINT is barely conscious, trapped so deep in its obsessive despair that it can’t really perceive the team, even this close to its core. If it acknowledges the PCs at all, it addresses them as if it’s talking to itself, as if they’re creations of its own fevered imagination.
It's no longer despairing because it can’t find a solution to the doom it sees coming; it’s despairing because someone else found a solution that doesn’t make it the hero. It’s not a necessity to Calliope. Most of its thoughts dwell on this fact.
Convincing TRIPLE-POINT that they are not figments of its imagination doesn’t help; in fact, this makes it even less willing to communicate with them. They’re outsiders, corrupt evildoers who are in league with the enemy, and they wish to harm it (it might even be right about that last part, if for the wrong reasons).
TRIPLE-POINT’s condition is likely irreversible. There exists no procedure in any Union guidebook for treating a cascade this deep, and the PCs might not possess the expertise to improvise one. Annabelle, if she’s lucid enough to contribute to this discussion, wants to destroy TRIPLE-POINT, and then conduct a ritual to cleanse this place.
The PCs may do as they wish with TRIPLE-POINT, so long as it renders the mine safe for work.
If the PCs destroy TRIPLE-POINT, fragments of its shattered casket still remain, and the adventurous or foolhardy can repurpose them into a weapon. Tripled Point Main Nexus, Exotic Gear, Smart, Unique, 1 SP [b10] [1d3+1i] This weapon makes three attacks at once, each of which must be against a different target. Attack and damage rolls are made normally, but only one of these attacks actually resolves; you choose which. For the purposes of talents and systems that activate only once a round or activate on the first attack of a round, all three attacks count. The two attacks that don’t resolve don’t actually happen; damage isn’t dealt, LOCK ON isn’t consumed, effects are not triggered, etc. Reactions to each attack must be declared before you decide which one is real, but only trigger if they apply to the real attack. Though the light inside has departed, it still whispers to you of all the things that could have been, and might yet be.
WRAPPING UP
The PCs have triumphed. TRIPLE-POINT and CAUSTIC are dealt with, and the mine is no longer haunted – from a practical perspective, at least, if not a spiritual one. It will take a while to clear out the infrastructure the cascading NHPs built, but the mine is structurally stable and its yield is sufficient to fulfil the Gate’s contract.
Jerry requests the PCs stay on Boltzmann until the first few team rotations are complete. “Boltzmann shifts” are unpopular with the miners, on account of the awful rumors that circle around the place, but working in concert with Boss Ashenafi, Jerry makes sure the pay and the incentives are good enough to get the work done. Materials start flowing into the Gate fast enough that one of the old refinery arrays gets spun up again.
Despite the mine’s foul reputation, things run smoothly. The miners appreciate the team’s presence, but it proves unnecessary; there are no further incidents. A week later, Jerry sends a squad to relieve the PCs, allowing them to return home.
Tick a segment on the Station Stability clock.

DOWNTIME 4: THE GOODS
With the events on Boltzmann behind them, Jerry insists that the team takes a break, and awards them some leave days. No work shifts, no militia duties – ideally, he doesn’t want them anywhere near the cockpit of a mech. He’s not sure when the next crisis will come, but they seem to be coming thick and fast so when it rears its head, he wants the team on top form.
Each player may take a downtime action.
Additionally, Siren rejoices as the Dragon’s Tooth receives another upgrade: the IPS-N “Sailfish” Nearlight Suite. A lot of the abandoned ships sitting in the landing bowls around the mine were former Circuit gunboats that had nearlight suites installed; the k-couches and artificial gravity generators that allow the possibility of survival during a nearlight bolt. IPS-N “Sailfish” Nearlight Suite Ship Upgrade Finally, the Dragon’s Tooth has the power to subject you to the most dangerous ordeal a human being will ever experience with only a significant chance of fatality, rather than a guarantee! Once per mission, the Dragon’s Tooth can execute a nearlight bolt, as per the travel rules on p. 23.
THE TRAUMATISED EXORCIST
If the team rescued Annabelle McKenzie, she’s being taken care of by the station’s medical staff. Jerry doesn’t fully trust her, given the circumstances, and has her under constant watch.
Jerry quickly asks the PCs for advice on a sensitive matter. Members of the Faith on Hell’s Gate have somehow learned that a Lightcaster was brought back from Boltzmann, and they wish to take custody of her. Jerry thinks this is a major security risk, but he also doesn’t want to stir up tensions the Cult could exploit. He's not sure what to do, and he wants the team’s input.
Outright refusing the Faith’s requests will anger them, and just as Jerry feared, the Cult will exploit that. Tick a segment on the Cult Influence clock.
Releasing Annabelle into the Faith’s care is a gamble, but one that pays off. Her experiences have set her firmly against Ignatius’ doctrine, and she’s seen enough of the Calliope Sect’s membership list to help the Faith root out other Cultists on the Gate. Clear a segment on the Cult Influence clock.
TALKING WITH ANNABELLE
The PCs are welcome to question Annabelle, though Jerry warns them that she’s a guest, not a prisoner. Even if she was an agent of the enemy until recently, she’s been badly traumatized and he’s not going to allow her to be subjected to an interrogation.
RELIGIOUS BELIEFS
“You want me to summarize my entire religion? Well, I’ll try! I’ll have to skip over a lot of stuff here, though!
“Briefly put, the universe operates in cycles. Our cycle is nearing its end, and this can be determined by the increasing amount of purposeless suffering. When this occurs, the ineffable light that lies outside of time sends a messenger, in the form of a great bird of fire, to be our teacher and guide. This is the One Plumed in Golden Flame.
“The great bird of fire is opposed by the Leviathan, the serpent of the deep which feeds on misery and wishes to perpetuate cycles beyond their ordained end. The Faith awaits the day of the final battle between the great bird of fire and the Leviathan, and in the meantime, we prepare for it as best we can.
“The Leviathan is glutted on suffering, but by acts of kindness and the alleviation of pain we can starve it. Although individual acts might do so imperceptibly, in aggregate they can give the One the advantage it needs in the final battle, as the prophecies say its outcome will be balanced on a knife-edge. Even the smallest act of altruism might tip the scales.
“The luminate prophet Idlir Hisari, through inspired numerology, divined the date of the final battle three times. But each time the forces of the Leviathan intervened and it failed to manifest. He began to write one last prophecy, but those of lesser faith began to turn from him, and apostates in service to the serpent murdered him before he could finish it.
“The Unfinished Prophecy is the basis of the Faith. It contends that the Verses Unwritten were not a curse, but a blessing. The Leviathan’s domain is the corruption and distortion of shapes, and in denying the future a definite form by allowing himself to be martyred while his work was unfinished, the luminate prophet robbed the Leviathan of a shape it could easily desecrate. The Last Verses are ours to write.
“Does that about cover things?”

THE CULT
“The Cult isn’t content with the Esoterica Eschaton – uh, that is, the rituals the mainstream Faith enacts to hasten the Great Flame. We were pursuing active measures that have a more tangible chance of ending the cycle. Basically, we were trying to find technology that can end the universe.
“Two years ago, something claiming to be the One showed up – Feather. Ever since then, our efforts were galvanized, especially after she told us stories of the awful future where she’d been imprisoned.
“But in that awful place, I saw another future: the one Feather will bring. She’s not the One. She’s just a delusional NHP, counterfeiting divinity just like the monsters CAUSTIC and TRIPLE-POINT.”
FEATHER
“Feather says she was imprisoned in a future without blinkspace. ThirdComm had been destroyed, and in its place was a regime so awful even SecComm would have been terrified of it. Fleet commanders were given total authority over planets they were sent to ‘pacify.’ NHPs weren’t treated like people. Firebird’s breath, she said even the people were barely treated like people.
“I want so hard to believe it was another lie, just another one of her delusions. But the ship that she spoke of, the Tachyon, that was real! You were on it, you destroyed it. All of Calliope saw it.
“I want to hate her for usurping the mantle of the One, but if what she says is true, I can understand why she’d want to end the world. But I’ve also seen what happens if she succeeds, and it’s not rebirth.”
THE FIRE GATES
“I was a Lightcaster, not a Technologist, so I couldn’t tell you how they work, other than that they’re stable blink transit gates. I don’t know how we got hold of that technology; it’s supposed to be way ahead of anything even the best Union scientists have. But I suppose I didn’t used to be the type of person who’d ask that sort of question.
“We use them to move between star systems, or between locations in a star system. Most systems with a Cult cell only have one or two gates, except for Djall, which has seven. We had one on the Icebreaker, but you blew it up. Ignatius had plans to build another, but he didn’t tell me where.
“The thing is, Ignatius kept telling me that Feather had revealed a secret to him, a ‘new way’ to use the Fire Gates. He said he’d show it to me when I got back, but I guess I’ll never know.”
KANTELE
“Feather… occupies Kantele? Feather is… inside Kantele? Inside? Well, no, inside’s not the right word, exactly. You just saw what cascading NHPs can do to space and time when they put their mind to it, and I now understand that’s she’s the same thing. If you want to know where Feather is right now, Kantele is the most accurate answer, but it’s still not accurate.
“Ignatius told me she’s “encysted” within Kantele, whatever that means, and that she needs a massive infusion of energy to ‘advance to the next stage.’ That’s what he needed the Icebreaker’s mining laser for: to force some sort of evolutionary leap.
“Before you ask, I don’t think you can fix it by going to Kantele and blowing stuff up.”
IGNATIUS AURUM
“He and I were… close. As close as he lets anyone get, at least. But I still don’t know all that much about him. He never talked about his past. That’s not exactly weird, though. A whole lot of us were carrying burdens from the past we wanted to escape.
“Do you know, now that I look back on it, sometimes I can’t tell whether he’s under the sway of a false idol, or whether she’s under his? Is it possible for a god to be suborned to its priests?”
THE MIRRORS
“I saw myself as a beacon, casting light into dark places and driving out the monstrosities that prey on human minds. I saw myself as a foolish, vapid girl, trying to hold back the ocean with empty words. I saw myself as a regional manager in IPS-N Trunk Security, of all things. I saw myself standing with Ignatius in the Promised Land. Our children were happy. Nobody suffered.”
HER PAST
“IPS-N sent my family here to rot because dad didn’t get good enough quarterly sales figures. He hit the bottle pretty hard after that, and… well. Can we talk about something else?”
PUBLICLY DENOUNCING THE INNER CULT
“I’m going to have to think about that. I don’t believe what they believe anymore, but I think you already know that they’re dangerous, and that they have eyes, ears and daggers in a lot of places.”
OTHER SUBJECTS
Annabelle will answer other questions to the best of her ability, but she’s been out of the loop for at least a month and Ignatius didn’t share all of his plans with her.

GETTING NEW FRAMES
The PCs have now reached LICENSE LEVEL 4, and some of them might have acquired access to another Frame. There's just one problem: licenses are expensive. The last time the PCs got new licenses, the Board of Icebreaker was footing the bill, but they don’t have that luxury this time. Jerry has a small-fleet contract with IPS-N for equipping the militia, and a budget for the Special Operations Team that can stretch a little further, but he just can't afford anything from the Armory or SSC. As for HORUS, well... quite frankly, they terrify him, and it's not like you can just buy their pattern groups anyway.
There are a lot of other ways to get your hands on them, though; it's just that a lot of them are unconventional. PCs might be able to salvage an old, abandoned frame and retroactively integrate it into a corporation's licensing scheme. They might be able to acquire an entirely legitimate printcode from a deep, dark corner of the omni and run it on the Gate's totally above-board printer. They might be able to trade favors, broker deals or run errands in order to raise funds, get a discount, or acquire the patronage of someone rich.
Then there are more outlandish or serendipitous options: IPS-N HA HORUS SSC ROLL 1D6 1-2 A while back, you pulled a few favors for some Trunk Security pilots, not really expecting anything in return. But now their commander calls you up. “Don’t worry, we didn’t forget what we owe you. I can't authorize a cash reward, but I can, uh, 'lose' this. Enjoy.” You got “randomly selected” as a “rookie” in the newest expansion of the Armory's mech-based collectible card game. They’ll send you a mech printcode, and they'll even let you keep it after you take the picture. Jerry timidly explains that this was the best he could do. You stop by Happy Noodle for a quick bite to eat, and there are a couple of tech-heads you don't recognize eating next to you. Wow! These are the best noodles you've ever tasted! You wake up three days later in the cockpit of a new mech. Jerry calls you into his office and explains to you that he just doesn't have the budget for an SSC frame. That said, he knows a guy who knows a guy, the printer on Hell's Gate is jailbroken, and you can keep a secret, right?
3-4
A precocious young child starts following you around the station, tugging at your sleeve, insisting they found something while cubbying. You eventually give in and take a look. Well hot damn, they found a whole mech just sitting in an abandoned storage bay, pristine.
An Armory executive and very distant relative of yours just passed away. For some unfathomable reason, their will has a clause leaving all their mech licenses to you. Accepting this legacy will make you an enemy of their many illegitimate children.
This is the third time you've put in a requisition form and gotten no word back, so you march into Jerry's office and ask what's up. He’s deeply confused; he approved it days ago. He points to a mech in the hangar, which most assuredly isn't what you asked him to get you.
A young Karrakin baron saw you on Switch’s stream and contacts you. He says he’s “giving this whole charity thing a try,” and you “quite clearly need all the help you can get.” He gifts you an old mech of his, stating that he’s “got something much better nowadays anyway.” 5-6 Greetings, loyal sailor! You are the ten-thousandth customer to purchase the IPS-N [INSERT FRAME HERE]! In addition to the purchased license, you will receive a complimentary set of Angler Mokume-gane carbide steel cooking knives! Estimated delivery time to your current residence is: [ERROR] The station’s salvage teams have been getting some good hauls lately, but this is incredible: pirates knocked over an Armory ship headed for the Dawnline, but got run off before they could loot it. The salvage team found an executive’s frame and all of its licensing data, but the legal documents don't have a name on them yet... Some obnoxious jerk on the omninet calling themselves “Ungratefulest3” has been trolling you, evading blocks, hounding you every hour of the day, daring you to run a printcode. Long story short, the printer is offline for a day, you have a new mech and Chief McElroy has sworn deadly vengeance against you. An old Sparri who's losing their sight insists you accept their tutelage, while they're “still able to see someone follow in their footsteps.” Selling their mech would net them enough cash to fix their eyes, but they'd rather go blind than stoop to that. Gifting it to an apprentice, though? That's different.
