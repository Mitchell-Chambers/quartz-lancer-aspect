Equally far from the grand bastion of Union and the shining frontier of the Dawnline Shore, but the political situation in Calliope is no less complex for its isolation. If anything, it's more so; the designs of entities like Union and Harrison Armory often play out over generations, their implications passing unnoticed to the man on the street. In Calliope, the state of the system’s politics and your position within them might well dictate whether you get to eat tonight, or whether you still have a home tomorrow. 
Each faction has a broadly-defined Core Mission: its overarching ambitions and goals. Not all members will agree on the method by which these goals should be achieved, nor will all members will even agree on the goals. It’s perfectly possible to find members pledging loyalty to a faction while pursuing their own agendas.
