## Chapter Summaries
Chapter 1 - The Tachyon Returns starts with a crisis on Hell’s Gate: the station’s only mana weaver is broken, and its absence is already causing major problems. Once the team have dealt with them, they must go in search of a replacement part. Their search takes them to the outer skies, to a recently discovered ghost ship – a ship also sought by Andros Capella, one of the region's most vicious pirates. A fight ensues, which ends in the ship’s destruction and Capella’s death, for which the team are assumed to be responsible.

Chapter 2 - Fire and Ice picks up a few weeks later. Rita, chancellor on the Icebreaker Borealis, wishes to hire the team off the back of their recent elimination of Capella. Something nefarious is happening on the Icebreaker, and she wants the them to deal with it. In the course of their investigation, the team meet the Cult of the One, a fanatical religious sect with apocalyptic intentions. Right now, they mean to use the Borealis’ old mining spell (?) to crack open a nearby island, which they believe will aid their god.

Chapter 3 - Some Sick Game begins in the midst of a spate of abductions, perpetrated by Calliope’s local doge tyrant Rodericke Steele. He means to force them to fight to the death in a new mech-centric blood sport. The pirate queen Mistress Elske hires the team to put a stop to these ambitions, and they must travel to Asphodel and journey across its vast wilderness to launch an assault on Steele’s arena. Meanwhile, they also meet another major actor in this drama: Ignatius Aurum, Priest of the One.

Chapter 4 - Circuit Breaker takes place two months later. Hell’s Gate has been awarded a lucrative mining opportunity, but it seems to be a poison chalice; something is very wrong with the cavern they’ve been asked to work at. It’s deep in the territory of The Circuit, a gang of piratical magno-cultists, and the previous outfit that worked there can’t be reached for comment. In fact, the whole of The Circuit has gone quiet as well. The team must delve into the mine and see what’s gone wrong.

Chapter 5 - The Herald of Change brings all the plot threads that have been gathering over the course of Act 1 together. A group of desperate pirates shows up, claiming that after the team killed Andros Capella, the Cult of the One seized control of their home base, Fort Cerberus and started constructing some kind of diabolical relic. Citizens of Hell’s Gate have been abducted to bear witness to a ritual. The local scry lines are going crazy. The team must travel to the Fort and put a stop to this before it gets out of hand. But a familiar face is waiting for them… Andros Capella.

Epilogue - The End of the Beginning allows the team some time to decompress and reflect on the events of the past five chapters, and sets up some of the plot threads that will be taken into Act 2.
