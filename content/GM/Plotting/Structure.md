Since the foundation campaign 'In Golden Flame' is currently in playtest beta, and that is only for ACT 1, I have no desire to carry forth without a key outline of the campaign going forward, or the work put in to develop ACT 2 and 3, it would not be fair on myself to carry the voice of the campaign forward, and it would not be fair on my players to present a diminished experience.  
  
In order to avoid burnout, the following plan is recommended.

1.  Play ACT 1 of IN GOLDEN FLAME for LANCER THE TABLETOP RPG
2.  Have the players understand that we will be alternating to another setting in order to prevent entering a rut and allow the return to ACT 2 of IN GOLDEN FLAME to be exciting.
3.  Start ACT 1 of Quest for the Frozen Flame for PATHFINDER SECOND EDITION
4.  Once finished with ACT 1, assess length compared to ACT 1 of IN GOLDEN FLAME, and determine if ACT 2 of Quest for the Frozen Flame is needed.
5.  During this period, engage in development of ACT 2 of IN GOLDEN FLAME, either through the primary game designer in Pilot.Net, or via Homebrew methods.
6.  Return to IN GOLDEN FLAME







# FROM ADVENTURE PATH
Taken straight from the ACT 1 Prerelease Draft

Act 1 covers Tier 1 play from LL 0-5. It introduces players and their characters to the mechanics of Lancer, the setting of Calliope and the story’s primary antagonists, the Cult of the One. It culminates in a battle that hints at the full extent of the Cult’s capabilities and ambitions.

Act 2 will cover Tier 2 play from LL 5-9. Stones are thrown into Calliope’s pond as several new factions arrive, each presenting their own opportunities and dangers to the system’s residents. While the team contend with these newcomers, they must also recruit allies and strengthen Calliope against the rapidly encroaching Cult. These preparations will be put to the test during a climactic assault on their home

Act 3 will cover Tier 3 play from LL9-12. This is the endgame. The Cult is now in open war with the rest of the system as it rushes to achieve its final, apocalyptic vision. Lives hang in the balance, and the player characters must pit their war machines against the servants of an awakening god.
