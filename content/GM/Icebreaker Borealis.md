STATION LAYOUT The station is built around the original CPS Borealis. An extensively modified Yabelo Industries Medr-class “ring eater,” the Borealis is almost ten kilometers long and once contained all the facilities necessary to produce several hundred thousand liters of fresh water every day. She would periodically dive into the rings of Kalevala, chewing her way through thousands of moonlets, a task she performed continually for more than a century with almost no stoppages. Eventually, the strain of continual use exhausted her systems beyond repair, and she was placed in a parking orbit outside of Kalevala’s radiation belts. The original plan was to scuttle the ship and salvage her for parts, but that left a whole lot of people without a job or a place to live other than Hell’s Gate. That wasn’t appealing, and so the ship was set into a gentle spin, serving as the core for a labyrinthine tangle of habitats clustered around it in a rough cylinder. Like Hell’s Gate and other spin stations, directions on the Icebreaker take the form of spin/anti-spin, up/down and aft/fore. The Icebreaker’s cylinder is five kilometers in diameter, and rotates about once every 90 seconds. Unlike Hell’s Gate or Impact Plaza, the Icebreaker wasn’t constructed to any sort of template or plan. New modules, sections and whole city blocks are bolted on as they become necessary, forming “the Sprawl.” Struts anchoring parts of the jury-rigged cylinder to the ship’s superstructure get added every few hundred meters. This prevents “the Wiggle,” a hazard in which insufficiently secured structural elements flail about and potentially collide with other sections. The Sprawl is loosely organized into dozens of “districts,” which range from a handful of modules to areas of the cylinder the size of a small city. There is no official definition for what does or doesn’t qualify as a district, but a general rule of thumb holds that a district is an area that contains the holdings of at least three Board members. Any fewer, and it’s likely just part of another district. As the station grew, its tangle of modules became increasingly complex and time-consuming to navigate. It’s only in the past couple of decades that it’s gotten a reliable public transit system, which Rita had to fight tooth and nail for. Even the simplified map looks like something out of a nightmare. There’s a tidy profit to be made for those willing to serve as guides, although visitors can also purchase a variety of navigation software packages. In comparison to the recent public transit system, the station has had a robust system of freight lines since its inception. These lines are built along the external surface of the cylinder, “underneath” the Sprawl. The trains are automated and it’s a good thing too, since the sheer number of junctions, branches and dead ends would make it impossible for a human to navigate. Most freight cars are large enough to accommodate a couple of Size 1 mechs, or one Size 2 mech uncomfortably. Life support functions such as water and air processing are distributed, handled by localized modules and always with some level of redundancy. Given that the richer districts can afford it, air and water quality in those areas tends to be better than in poorer districts. Unlike Hell’s Gate, there exists no station-wide ban on smoking or open flames, although certain districts may have local statutes.

LOCATIONS The Pocket Guide to the Icebreaker, available from any street vendor, recommends that a visit to the station should include “a full range of experiences.” The Icebreaker is large enough that just about any form of entertainment can be found if you know where to look, but here are some highlights. THE STARSTRIP “Try your luck in the Long Rim’s most luxurious gambling halls! Take a load off in unrivalled comfort at our galaxy-class resorts! Bask in the talent of our exclusive shows and acts! The Starstrip: walk the road to the stars.” The Starstrip is the only thoroughfare to run the entire ten-kilometer length of the Sprawl, in a bizarre path that twists, winds and loops several times around the cylinder. It links all of the major casinos, hotels, shopping malls and theatres. There’s a saying: “you’re not on the Board unless you’re on the Starstrip.” It’s not quite universal, but it’s close. The Starstrip bustles at every hour of the day and night, a constant churn of people seeking excitement, distraction or oblivion. Given the clientele is often ships making a stopover between Rao Co and the Dawnline Shore, reservations at high-class establishments are often booked years or even decades in advance. In its full-issue edition on the Icebreaker, the Annamite Cultural Review rated the Gift-Bronze Casino and Resort as “the number one gambling establishment in the Long Rim,” citing its tasteful neo-deco architecture, attentive staff and unrivalled wine selection. This article became a point of contention when a disgruntled former employee of the Cultural Review accused its editor-in-chief of accepting extravagant bribes from Evelina Bondarchuk, the owner of the Gift-Bronze. HISTORIC BOREALIS “Marvel at the inner workings of Calliope’s largest industrial spaceship, and relive its proud history with one of our affordable guided tours! Proof of zero-g training and signed safety waiver required.” Sections of the CPS Borealis are open to the public, and some areas have been converted into exhibitions on the history of both the ship and Calliope at large. Guided tours are available for a nominal fee. Most of the ship’s engineering sections are cordoned off, since its reactor and life support systems are necessary for the station’s continued survival. The ship’s mining laser was broken down for parts more than a century ago. Its engines, while still intact, aren’t functional; a good thing, since the station likely doesn’t have the structural integrity to handle acceleration. GLADIATOR’S DRAW AND QUARTER “Your thirst for mech-on-mech destruction might never be sated, but we gave it our best shot at the Draw and Quarter!” Live mech combat is far and away Calliope’s favourite extreme sport, outpacing jovian windsurfing by a wide margin. In fact, it’s one of Calliope’s most successful breakout industries: a vast subculture of Union citizens thirst for mech violence that isn’t legal to conduct anywhere in Union space. The Quarter provides. Although only the Moon Glacier League is officially “native” to the Icebreaker, the Thunderstorm and Hellfire Leagues hold most of their matches in the Draw and Quarter. This suits the Thunderstorm League just fine, since it’s a joint SSC and IPS-N venture handled mostly by people who don’t even work in the system. On the other hand, it upsets a lot of Hellfire League fans that not a single match of the Gate’s “native” League is actually held on Hell’s Gate. By popular vote, the top ten arenas in the Quarter are The Mechropolis, Laserhäus, Deadmetal, One Weird Trick Shot, Ring of Fate, All Tomorrow’s Junkers, The Despair Shop, House of Godhead, Don’t Tell Management and a HORUS-operated joint marked only by a memetic glyph that is inherently understood to mean “mech fighting ring” by those who read it. There’s always at least a couple of League matches happening on any given day, but non-League matches and tournaments happen round the clock. The Quarter’s concourses never sleep, and neither do its three Schedule 2 printers. RAPHAEL BAZA’S BIZARRE BAZAAR “They say there’s some things that money can’t buy. We say they should’ve tried the Bizarre Bazaar!” There are marketplaces, malls and shopping concourses all over the Icebreaker, but by far the most prestigious is the Bizarre Bazaar. Operated by Raphael Baza, a flamboyant and eccentric member of the Board, the Bazaar is a colossal establishment that occupies an entire district by itself.

Thousands of merchants hold court there every day, selling every conceivable thing, each paying half their profits to Baza. That’s the genius of the Bazaar: there’s so much space that he can hand it out for free, and you only need to pay him if you break even. This leads to the Bazaar’s famous variety of goods and services. For more successful, ambitious or specialized vendors, the Bazaar also has a plethora of shopfronts available for rent. The average operating life of a cafe in the Bazaar is four months. [90] SERENDIPITY RESORT HOTEL “If you want Armory Executive treatment without Armory Executive prices, look no further than the Serendipity Resort Hotel. Serendipity Resort Hotel: ain’t chance a funny thing?” Rita hasn’t paid for the PCs to stay in the pinnacle of luxury, but she hasn’t stiffed them either: unless they specifically want to make other arrangements, she’s had rooms booked for them at the Serendipity Resort Hotel, an upmarket establishment that provides tasteful comfort without breaking the bank. It has three bars, a restaurant, a sauna and a swimming pool. While Rita is perfectly happy to pay for the PCs’ room and board, she’s not going to be impressed if they try to expense any major cleaning or repair bills. 

FAIRYLAND “”

UNCROWNED KING BAR AND GRILLE “If you’re looking for the authentic down-home Long Rim tavern experience, you can find it down any number of alleyways and access corridors! Please remember that station security forces can’t always guarantee a response time of less than five minutes!” The Uncrowned King Bar and Grille is a crummy dive in the Gladiator’s Draw and Quarter, with a rentable backroom that overlooks the House of Godhead mech arena. Dark, noisy, poorly-cleaned, with tasteless beer and little variety in its harder liquors, it’s mediocre at best. But it’s for this very reason that Rita chooses to hold clandestine meetings with the PCs here – being from Hell’s Gate, they won’t seem out of place, but nobody would think to look for a Board member here.
