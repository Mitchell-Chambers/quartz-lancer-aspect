They say the giant's forged her, in the before times, so it could crave a path to Nelf. It's said they started by molding it in the palm of their hand, rubbing mana thick, layer by layer until it's friction made incarnate. And I've seen the 'breaker, and so all I have to ask is this: 
How fucking big were the giants?

She's a cup, fit for kings of eld to dine on continents of ice and doze through the shattering of the world. There are many like her, but this one is ours, and she feeds Borealis just fine.

There's a problem with the way of things. Mana might bleed the air and flood the lungs, pirates might claw at the throats of the choking and starving, and the Union will never reach us before someone finally settles the Calliopian Succession Crisis. But the true issue is the same everywhere.
Water is not magic.
It seems like a strange thing to say, great stone works can be pulled whole shape from the mana, it easily ignites into flame if inclined, it's flows and tides fill the sails of our airships, acting as lighter than the wind and always beneath our wings. But water?
Inert. Useless.
It's a cruel joke of the gods that no matter the number of attuned, chosen, wizards and artifers, the whole lot would more likely stroke out like an inbred king of a dwarf kingdom than summon a droplet from the sky.
But Icebreaker? That shit was built different. They wrote the rules while we played by them. Take a cup from the table of the gods and never go thirsty again. So long as you are willing to work for it.

## STATION LAYOUT 
The station is built around the original CPS Borealis. An extensively modified Yabelo Industries Medr-class “ring eater,” the Borealis is almost ten kilometers long and once contained all the facilities necessary to produce several hundred thousand liters of fresh water every day. She would periodically dive into the rings of Kalevala, chewing her way through thousands of moonlets, a task she performed continually for more than a century with almost no stoppages. Eventually, the strain of continual use exhausted her systems beyond repair, and she was placed in a parking orbit outside of Kalevala’s radiation belts. The original plan was to scuttle the ship and salvage her for parts, but that left a whole lot of people without a job or a place to live other than Hell’s Gate. That wasn’t appealing, and so the ship was set into a gentle spin, serving as the core for a labyrinthine tangle of habitats clustered around it in a rough cylinder. Like Hell’s Gate and other spin stations, directions on the Icebreaker take the form of spin/anti-spin, up/down and aft/fore. The Icebreaker’s cylinder is five kilometers in diameter, and rotates about once every 90 seconds. Unlike Hell’s Gate or Impact Plaza, the Icebreaker wasn’t constructed to any sort of template or plan. New modules, sections and whole city blocks are bolted on as they become necessary, forming “the Sprawl.” Struts anchoring parts of the jury-rigged cylinder to the ship’s superstructure get added every few hundred meters. This prevents “the Wiggle,” a hazard in which insufficiently secured structural elements flail about and potentially collide with other sections. The Sprawl is loosely organized into dozens of “districts,” which range from a handful of modules to areas of the cylinder the size of a small city. There is no official definition for what does or doesn’t qualify as a district, but a general rule of thumb holds that a district is an area that contains the holdings of at least three Board members. Any fewer, and it’s likely just part of another district. As the station grew, its tangle of modules became increasingly complex and time-consuming to navigate. It’s only in the past couple of decades that it’s gotten a reliable public transit system, which Rita had to fight tooth and nail for. Even the simplified map looks like something out of a nightmare. There’s a tidy profit to be made for those willing to serve as guides, although visitors can also purchase a variety of navigation software packages. In comparison to the recent public transit system, the station has had a robust system of freight lines since its inception. These lines are built along the external surface of the cylinder, “underneath” the Sprawl. The trains are automated and it’s a good thing too, since the sheer number of junctions, branches and dead ends would make it impossible for a human to navigate. Most freight cars are large enough to accommodate a couple of Size 1 mechs, or one Size 2 mech uncomfortably. Life support functions such as water and air processing are distributed, handled by localized modules and always with some level of redundancy. Given that the richer districts can afford it, air and water quality in those areas tends to be better than in poorer districts. Unlike Hell’s Gate, there exists no station-wide ban on smoking or open flames, although certain districts may have local statutes.

## LOCATIONS 
The Pocket Guide to the Icebreaker, available from any street vendor, recommends that a visit to the station should include “a full range of experiences.” The Icebreaker is large enough that just about any form of entertainment can be found if you know where to look, but here are some highlights. 

### THE STARSTRIP 
“Try your luck in the Long Rim’s most luxurious gambling halls! Take a load off in unrivalled comfort at our galaxy-class resorts! Bask in the talent of our exclusive shows and acts! The Starstrip: walk the road to the stars.” The Starstrip is the only thoroughfare to run the entire ten-kilometer length of the Sprawl, in a bizarre path that twists, winds and loops several times around the cylinder. It links all of the major casinos, hotels, shopping malls and theatres. There’s a saying: “you’re not on the Board unless you’re on the Starstrip.” It’s not quite universal, but it’s close. The Starstrip bustles at every hour of the day and night, a constant churn of people seeking excitement, distraction or oblivion. Given the clientele is often ships making a stopover between Rao Co and the Dawnline Shore, reservations at high-class establishments are often booked years or even decades in advance. In its full-issue edition on the Icebreaker, the Annamite Cultural Review rated the Gift-Bronze Casino and Resort as “the number one gambling establishment in the Long Rim,” citing its tasteful neo-deco architecture, attentive staff and unrivalled wine selection. This article became a point of contention when a disgruntled former employee of the Cultural Review accused its editor-in-chief of accepting extravagant bribes from Evelina Bondarchuk, the owner of the Gift-Bronze. 

### HISTORIC BOREALIS 
“Marvel at the inner workings of Calliope’s largest industrial spaceship, and relive its proud history with one of our affordable guided tours! Proof of zero-g training and signed safety waiver required.” Sections of the CPS Borealis are open to the public, and some areas have been converted into exhibitions on the history of both the ship and Calliope at large. Guided tours are available for a nominal fee. Most of the ship’s engineering sections are cordoned off, since its reactor and life support systems are necessary for the station’s continued survival. The ship’s mining laser was broken down for parts more than a century ago. Its engines, while still intact, aren’t functional; a good thing, since the station likely doesn’t have the structural integrity to handle acceleration. 

### GLADIATOR’S DRAW AND QUARTER 
“Your thirst for mech-on-mech destruction might never be sated, but we gave it our best shot at the Draw and Quarter!” Live mech combat is far and away Calliope’s favourite extreme sport, outpacing jovian windsurfing by a wide margin. In fact, it’s one of Calliope’s most successful breakout industries: a vast subculture of Union citizens thirst for mech violence that isn’t legal to conduct anywhere in Union space. The Quarter provides. Although only the Moon Glacier League is officially “native” to the Icebreaker, the Thunderstorm and Hellfire Leagues hold most of their matches in the Draw and Quarter. This suits the Thunderstorm League just fine, since it’s a joint SSC and IPS-N venture handled mostly by people who don’t even work in the system. On the other hand, it upsets a lot of Hellfire League fans that not a single match of the Gate’s “native” League is actually held on Hell’s Gate. By popular vote, the top ten arenas in the Quarter are The Mechropolis, Laserhäus, Deadmetal, One Weird Trick Shot, Ring of Fate, All Tomorrow’s Junkers, The Despair Shop, House of Godhead, Don’t Tell Management and a HORUS-operated joint marked only by a memetic glyph that is inherently understood to mean “mech fighting ring” by those who read it. There’s always at least a couple of League matches happening on any given day, but non-League matches and tournaments happen round the clock. The Quarter’s concourses never sleep, and neither do its three Schedule 2 printers.

### RAPHAEL BAZA’S BIZARRE BAZAAR 
“They say there’s some things that money can’t buy. We say they should’ve tried the Bizarre Bazaar!” There are marketplaces, malls and shopping concourses all over the Icebreaker, but by far the most prestigious is the Bizarre Bazaar. Operated by Raphael Baza, a flamboyant and eccentric member of the Board, the Bazaar is a colossal establishment that occupies an entire district by itself.

Thousands of merchants hold court there every day, selling every conceivable thing, each paying half their profits to Baza. That’s the genius of the Bazaar: there’s so much space that he can hand it out for free, and you only need to pay him if you break even. This leads to the Bazaar’s famous variety of goods and services. For more successful, ambitious or specialized vendors, the Bazaar also has a plethora of shopfronts available for rent. The average operating life of a cafe in the Bazaar is four months. [90] 

### SERENDIPITY RESORT HOTEL 
“If you want Armory Executive treatment without Armory Executive prices, look no further than the Serendipity Resort Hotel. Serendipity Resort Hotel: ain’t chance a funny thing?” Rita hasn’t paid for the PCs to stay in the pinnacle of luxury, but she hasn’t stiffed them either: unless they specifically want to make other arrangements, she’s had rooms booked for them at the Serendipity Resort Hotel, an upmarket establishment that provides tasteful comfort without breaking the bank. It has three bars, a restaurant, a sauna and a swimming pool. While Rita is perfectly happy to pay for the PCs’ room and board, she’s not going to be impressed if they try to expense any major cleaning or repair bills. 

### FAIRYLAND

### UNCROWNED KING BAR AND GRILLE “
If you’re looking for the authentic down-home Long Rim tavern experience, you can find it down any number of alleyways and access corridors! Please remember that station security forces can’t always guarantee a response time of less than five minutes!” 
The Uncrowned King Bar and Grille is a crummy dive in the Gladiator’s Draw and Quarter, with a rentable backroom that overlooks the House of Godhead mech arena. Dark, noisy, poorly-cleaned, with tasteless beer and little variety in its harder liquors, it’s mediocre at best. But it’s for this very reason that Rita chooses to hold clandestine meetings with the PCs here – being from Hell’s Gate, they won’t seem out of place, but nobody would think to look for a Board member here.


# DAILY LIFE 
Life on the Icebreaker is defined by a sharp divide, whether you’re a visitor or a resident: money. If you have money, the Icebreaker is open to you. If you don’t, it’s a daunting and unkind place. A lot of people who’ve been to the Icebreaker speak of it in the same terms: it’s a lovely place to visit, but it looks like a hard place to live. They’re right. It takes a lot of money to live comfortably here, and most people don’t earn enough to stay in comfort for long. Sure, there are parts of the Icebreaker where a poor person can live, but it’s not much of a life. The Board really only cares for the bits of the station that the visitors are likely to see, and as far as they’re concerned, their workers’ quality of life is their own problem. High-quality services, be they food, housing or medical care, all come with a steep price tag. Still, the Icebreaker does need its menial workers, and it’s not like they can commute from somewhere else. Since she became station director, Rita has done her best to ensure some basic services for the less fortunate. It’s not much, but it still manages to be better than what Hell’s Gate can provide – most of the time. The Icebreaker’s local currency is “icicles”, circular plastic coins made to look like ice, bearing the stylised image of a god of fortune on one side and the Board of Icebreaker’s logo on the other. They’re infused with glitter, to draw attention and make putting them on the line at a casino look impressive. The denomination of an icicle is marked numerically, although they also vary in colour and sparkle. To prevent counterfeiting, each icicle contains a unique RFID chip. In addition to icicles, the Icebreaker also accepts manna, corprostate scrip and various currencies from Diasporan worlds. It accepts Hell’s Gate ingots, although at a poor exchange rate to icicles. It was forced to accept Impact Plaza’s new “Steele Bars” at an artificially inflated exchange rate, with the implication being that Impact Dynamics would raise rates on water and essential foodstuffs if they didn’t. The station functions on Cradle Standard Time, with a twelve-hour day and twelve-hour night. Kalevala orbits so far from Calliope’s star that “daylight” is provided by massive floodlights mounted on the Borealis’ hull. A lot of the Starstrip exists under permanent night, because it looks sexier that way. SCENES FROM THE ICEBREAKER 1-2 Neon billboards the size of skyscrapers shine their gaudy messages into space. Each one consumes enough power to run a hab block for a month. 3-4 A street comedian does an unflattering impression of John Creighton Harrison II to gales of laughter from the public. A Colonial legionnaire in the crowd is getting visibly angrier as the act goes on, which only encourages the impersonator. 5-6 A scalper offers tickets to a Moon Glacier League mech fight that’s happening later this afternoon. The prices he’s charging are outrageous. 7-8 Station security forces attempt to clear away a small group of panhandlers, and would clearly be getting more violent if they weren’t being watched. 9-10 A croupier leans against a junction box, clutching a coffee in trembling hands, clearly trying not to cry. They look completely exhausted. 11-12 A street food vendor sells hot burritos and cheap coffee from their cart. Every so often, they throw a nervous glance at a burly man leaning on a nearby wall. 13-14 There’s a solemn affair going on at a bar. Initially, you think it’s a wake for a deceased person, but they’re alive and here at the gathering. They finally got enough money to leave Calliope for good, and the event feels like a wake because none of these people are ever going to see the departing person face-to-face again. 15-16 There’s a small commotion as a member of the Board is escorted somewhere by a retinue of heavily-armed private security. They’re very aggressive with anyone who gets too close. 17-18 A line of show-dancers prance and highkick at the opening of some special event a casino is holding. Their outfits are ridiculous; somehow, they seem to be overdressed and scanty at the same time. 19-20 In the shadows of an alleyway, there’s a glint as icicles change hands. A small package is passed in return. Although you can’t see their faces clearly, you realise both parties have noticed you, and they hastily depart in opposite directions.

EQUIPMENT All manner of goods, services and equipment can be found on the Icebreaker Borealis, assuming you know where to look and who to talk to. CARDCOUNT_V7.7.7_FINAL.OMEX 2 SP, Exotic Gear, Unique, Protocol, 2l(Self) For the rest of the turn, this system becomes charged and you can’t take full actions until the start of your next turn. If, during a quick action, you make an attack roll that misses or force a save that an enemy passes, expend the system’s charge. That quick action didn’t really happen; you made a probability calculation that returned an unfavourable result. Limited charges aren’t expended, loading weapons aren’t unloaded, reactions aren’t triggered, and so on. You must then choose a different quick action, and perform it instead. If you don’t use it, this system loses its charge at the end of your turn, as the calculation’s initial conditions no longer reflect reality. Card-counting devices and programs are banned everywhere on the Icebreaker; it’s one of the few things the Board can agree on. What makes this specific distro special (and even more illegal) is that somehow, it also works on slot machines, roulette wheels and mech fights. Programmers hired to examine it reported a tangle of neural-network-written paracode that calls variables antichronally. A GUN WITH A STORY There’s a tale of two duelling lancers who cut a trail of gold and crimson across Calliope in their twin Raleighs. Marika Wren was a pirate, Lin Zhihao a bounty hunter, and their names are legendary, as are their custom firearms. Most people think they’re just a myth, a fairytale, that they never existed. They’re wrong. The Golden Hand Auxiliary CQB, Exotic Gear, Loading, Reliable 1, Unique [b5] [a3] [1d6i] On Critical Hit: After this attack, reload every weapon in this mount. If you install the Golden Hand in the same mount as the Crimson Hand, they count as only one piece of Exotic Gear for installation limits. Marika was fast as lightning, and she had to be: she could never aim worth a damn. Zhihao was quick to mock her wide shots, and it made her blush. When your mech levels it, you smell whiskey, cigar smoke and rose perfume, hear the sound of dancing, and you want to laugh like the devil. This weapon presents a sidequest. During an appropriate downtime action on the Icebreaker, you may present the Golden Hand to a PC as a reward. Most likely, someone wagers it in a poker game, but it could be sold in the Bizarre Bazaar, offered as a payment instead of money, or even found discarded in a scrapheap by someone unaware of its true value. Introduce the weapon’s associated mythology. The mere existence of the Golden Hand implies that its equal and opposite, the Crimson Hand, is also out there somewhere. Moreover, the legend says that no matter how far they’re separated from each other in space or time, the guns are destined to reunite. Just owning the Golden Hand will lead you to the Crimson Hand – or so the story goes. Start a three-segment Seeking the Crimson Hand clock. The character who possesses the Golden Hand will have the opportunity to uncover more of this story in future chapters. GOING SHOPPING The Icebreaker Borealis boasts what is quite possibly the foremost shopping experience in the known universe. Free from Union oversight, almost anything can be bought and sold here. In particular, Raphael Baza’s Bizarre Bazaar is a marketplace the size of an entire district.

MARKETPLACE WARES ROLL 1D20 
1 A box of mint-condition Calliope Project T-shirts in various sizes. The logo depicts Calliope’s nine planets, Furnace City, Impact Plaza, Hell’s Gate, the CPS Borealis and several hands all clutching the haft of a very long spanner with the Project’s motto underneath: “our many hands shall build heaven here.” 
2 A black cube. In darkness, it casts interlinked geometric patterns of faint, colorful light on its surroundings, although this light can’t be seen when looking directly at it.
3 An oversized Venty the Vent Crab plush toy. Apparently, the printcode for these things was developed early in the Pyrite Age, before they became the bane of the system’s engineering teams. Nonetheless, children keep asking for them, so they keep getting made. 
4 A framed photograph of eight scientists in hardsuits, standing in front of a terraforming station on the surface of Asphodel. It’s dated at least two hundred years ago. One of them is a smiling young woman with eyes full of hope, apparently the subject of the picture. There’s something haunting about it. 
5 A twelve-pack of antitumor whitewash ampoules. These were a milestone development in cancer treatment back in their day, but they’ve since been replaced by more advanced technologies that provoke a less drastic immune response. Still, for people who don’t have nanite allergies, these things work just fine and they’re dirt cheap.
6 A small hard drive. It’s filled entirely with pictures of mechs, over which someone has constructed various sentences by cutting and pasting text sections from their owners’ manuals. The narratives range from humorous to deeply suggestive. 
7 A set of fully poseable, 1/30th scale figurines of the IPS-N mechanized chassis line. The vendor’s got every single one, even the outdated Yi-Sun-Shin, the troubled Ramses and the cancelled Albuquerque, except for the Caliban. “I just don’t like the idea of selling that thing to kids,” the vendor mumbles. 
8 An old, sun-bleached book of poetry from a Diasporan planet called Pallas. It describes the simultaneous monotony and horror of being “ruled by the endless echoes of a madman,” of recalling a coronation where the new monarch wore the same face as the old one, and smiled with the eyes of a murderer. 
9 A pack of POWER! Protein Bars, which bill themselves as "the coming revolution in food technology." These snacks can be printed via a printer, but unlike printloaf, they have genuine taste and texture. This is supposed to be a mixed sample pack, but contains only "Salmonberry Apocalypse" flavor. 
10 A scuffed, dull bronze sphere slightly larger than a human fist, with circuit-like designs carved into its surface. It’s not as heavy as its appearance suggests. 
11 A beautiful, glittering geode that was pulled out of an asteroid a few years back. It’s faintly radioactive, enough that the crystals fluoresce under UV light, but the vendor assures you it’s perfectly safe. This doesn’t stop it from setting off every single radiological alarm you pass on the way home. 
12 A Smith-Shimano Saraswati electric guitar. It’s a mid-level purchase: a dependable, high-quality piece, but not something you have to mortgage your organs to afford. This one’s being sold on the cheap because it looks like someone spent a while slamming it against something. 
13 A collection of old optical data discs, using an ancient data encoding format. They contain animations depicting what appear to be cyborgs living in the late era of Old Humanity, and some kind of primitive mech that vaguely resembles a Death’s Head. 
14 A signed physical copy of Moments of Crystallized Liminality, Cerulean Enceladus’ seventh studio album. The Annamite Cultural Review described it as “a pleasing return to form, not just for Cerulean, but for the entire nu-retro-stasiscore genre after a disappointing showing in 5015. Four out of five stars.” 
15 A talisman made from the tooth of some large predatory mammal, carved in intricate patterns. The Sparri selling them tells you up front that it’s the only thing in their stall worth buying. Everything else is “trash for tourists” but this, they assure you, is “the real deal.” Maybe that justifies the much higher price tag. 
16 A weathered paperback novel. It’s a first-edition print of a historical romance written during the First Expansion Period and set during the Little Wars. You’re baffled to discover that it contains references to an omninode, something that couldn’t have existed either when it was set or when it was written.
17 A jewel-encrusted gold broach from a minor Karrakin house. This would cost a small fortune planetside, but here in space, gold is ubiquitous and the jewels have no industrial value, so this thing’s literally worth less than a cup of coffee. 
18 An ancient, battered data storage device, centuries old at the least. It still works, and checks suggest it contains nearly twenty-nine terabytes of data – 97% of its storage capacity. The vendor’s letting it go for almost nothing because all that data is encrypted and write-protected – you can’t even delete it. 
19 A box labelled “the comprehensive solution to writer’s block.” There’s nothing inside it. You can’t tell whether its contents were stolen, or whether this is some insufferable person’s idea of a joke. 
20 A bootleg recording of LeClerc’s Seventh Symphony, a composition which necessitated the invention of a new form of three-dimensional musical notation just to express. It psychologically traumatized sixteen of the twenty-three orchestras who attempted to play it. Recordings and performances of the symphony are banned on at least three Union core worlds under public safety ordinances.
