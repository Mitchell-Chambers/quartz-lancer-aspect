RITA 
SHE/HER 
ACTUAL STATION DIRECTOR 
If Rita has a last name, nobody ever says it out loud. A practical, calculating leader who grew up immersed in the Icebreaker’s ruthless politics, she looks at almost everything in her life as a problem to be solved. Despite her coldness, Rita really does have the interests of the Icebreaker’s people at heart; after all, someone has to. Of the many weapons in her arsenal, Rita’s two greatest are her ability to make her goals seem beneficial to others, and her ability to hide her motives. She knows how to make people think they came up with her schemes themselves, and she can do it without tipping her hand. These skills are essential for convincing the Board to do anything, as they perceive any idea or agenda other than their own as a threat. As Rita herself would explain it to the few people she trusts, “never have your own ideas. Just have all of theirs for them.” She’s tall and severe, with immaculately coifed black hair and a steely gaze. She wears glasses, although she doesn’t need them, and a snow-white suit with lines so sharp they’d put the Terashima Enclave to shame. She radiates an aura of effortless calm and superiority. If you were to remark to her that she’s a contrast to Jerry Masters in every single way, she’d laugh and agree with you, then frown and tell you never to compare her to him again. As an employer, Rita doesn’t micromanage. She hires people who’ve proven their competence, tells them precisely what she wants, tells them what they need to know, and then trusts them to work out how to do it. The only thing she wants is the result she asked for: how you get it is usually unimportant. She always pays what she owes promptly, and never forgets a favor.

FAYAD HARB 
HE/HIM
ICEBREAKER ENGINEERING UNION CHIEF 
People look at the Icebreaker’s glittering neon dreamscape and call it magical – and that view tends to make them think everything here happens by magic. But it doesn’t. It takes thousands of man-hours of backbreaking labor every day to keep this tangled engineering nightmare running, and if you let the people up top forget that for even a second, everyone suffers. Enter people like Fayad Harb. Fayad and a small number of other union bosses sit on the Board as a counterbalance to the executives and commercial interests that otherwise tend to dominate it. The rest of the Board would dearly like to get rid of them, but the saving grace of the Icebreakers’ unions is that there’s so much enmity and distrust between the station’s elite that their anti-union initiatives are scattershot and ineffective. A short, energetic man, Fayad sports a permanent tenday beard, missing a section directly under his chin. His hair’s mostly silver, despite the fact that he doesn’t look that old. He’s friendly to those he trusts, but can get quite vicious with people he disapproves of. He assumes any action by the wealthier members of the Board is a threat to his people; an uncharitable outlook, but rarely wrong. He refrains from drink, but smokes almost constantly, even while working. 

KILEYNA MORTON 
THEY/THEM 
UNION LIASON TO CALLIOPE 
It took almost a century for Calliope to cross the desk of anyone at the Union Administrative Bureau. They promptly deemed the system too unimportant to warrant sending an Administrator, and fobbed the system off on the Bureau of Orbital and Non-Terrestrial Management, who sent a civilian liaison. Kileyna is the eighth appointee to this position. Short and bronze-skinned, their dark hair has a few streaks of white despite the fact that they don’t look a day over twenty-five. They tend to dress in muted colors, usually including at least an element of grey, and they have an unconscious habit of rubbing their right thumb against their left middle finger when they’re stressed. They’re empathetic and happy to listen, but they have to maintain a level of detachment for their own mental health. Every day, they hear the woes of a great number of people, and they can’t always help. Kileyna has a difficult job: to represent Union and its utopian goals in a place defined by the absence of both. Almost everyone in Calliope resents Union in some way. Many resent that there’s widespread suffering and hardship that Union could fix, but doesn’t. An equal number resent the idea of Union chipping away at Calliope’s independence. There’s folk out here who personally remember the days of SecComm, and don’t trust Union because of it – and an unsettling few who are upset those days are past. This isn’t helped by Union’s general opinion on the Long Rim: that its humanitarian issues could be solved if it just stopped existing, and everyone was relocated somewhere nicer. Kileyna advocates for an organization that wants to make their job obsolete to people who despise it; an irony their critics delight in.
With those difficulties in mind, Kileyna’s work ethic is exemplary. It’s down to their tireless, thankless effort that Union assigns an aid budget to Calliope at all. The neutral omninode, bringing omninet access to all without a price tag, is an accomplishment of theirs. They got a Union Navy carrier assigned to the system, and the naysayers called it “overreach,” while at the same time whining that it wasn’t a full battlegroup. In their darker moments, they remind themselves: doing good is its own reward, even if nobody thanks you.

IRVIN REID 
HE/HIM 
THE VOICE OF ICEBREAKER PUBLIC RADIO 
If you’ve tuned into public channels in Calliope, you’ve heard Irvin Reid. He has a voice that could melt butter and a wit to back it up. In defiance of radio tradition, he looks exactly like he sounds: tall, dark, handsome, and settling into middle age with practiced dignity. He’s also one of the few human beings who can pull off a fedora. He has an almost mystical way of describing day-today news, making situations seem at once vivid and deeply relatable. He has a reputation for refusing to sugar-coat or pull his punches, but also for avoiding hyperbole; his descriptions might veer fantastical on occasion, but he still tells it exactly as it is. Irvin is one of Rita’s closest allies. She convinced the Board to sponsor Icebreaker Public Radio, while keeping it free of corporate influence, making it one of the most trusted news sources in the system. 

SMITH JOHNSON 
THEY/THEM 
IPS-N REGIONAL MANAGER 
Smith Johnson is the highest-ranking IPS-N employee in Calliope. This is a punishment far beyond simple reassignment to the Long Rim, which happens to any number of IPS-N staff who make one too many screwups. No, Smith’s job is much worse: they’re responsible for all these rejects now. So far as IPS-N is concerned, any further mistakes they make are Smith’s fault. Paunchy, middle-aged, with thinning hair, Smith routinely overindulges to deal with the immense stress of their job. They wear a vast array of dataplating so that they never miss a beat; there’s always some fire that needs putting out, and the longer they leave it, the hotter it burns. They’re always exhausted, and it shows. Despite their desperate position, Smith’s been able to celebrate a couple of victories. It’s not exactly the most profitable deal ever, but the small-fleet contract with Hell’s Gate generated substantial goodwill. Trunk Security has seen an uptick in contracts, too. Surely, there’s got to be something they can do to convince IPS-N they’re not a total loser? Smith is likely who the PCs will talk to should they have dealings with IPS-N. If they seem like they have money, Smith is almost pathetically eager to please.

LOKI VALENTINIAN 
HE/HIM 
THE PRODIGAL SON 
A pale youth with messy black hair, a winning smile and a twinkle of mischief in his eyes. His entire being exudes a constant, infectious energy. He never seems to be able to sit completely still, some part of his body always moving – usually his hands, fiddling with a pen or some part of his uniform. Loki is a Harrison Armory corporal, and one of the few friendly members of the Armory the PCs are likely to meet in the near future. If the PCs engage Loki in conversation, while he’s happy to talk, he tries to avoid saying anything about himself. However, if he thinks holding back will lose the PCs’ trust, he’ll open up a little. He’s the son of Dr. Odin Valentinian, a prestigious Armory executive and weapons designer. There was a terrible accident at the research facility during a test of one of his father’s prototypes, and his twin brother Baldur was lost. Loki blames Odin for Baldur’s death, and signed up with the Legion to get away from it all. But now he’s learnt that his father is coming out to Calliope for some reason, and Loki definitely doesn’t want to be here when he arrives. Speaking about his family is the only thing that dims Loki’s smile. 

HOWL 
SHE/HER 
REIGNING HELLFIRE LEAGUE CHAMPION 
A towering, muscular woman, her skin covered in tattoos of wolves and other lupine creatures. She’s a regular in all three of the Icebreaker’s mech-fighting circuits and reigning champion of the Hellfire League (during Act 1, at least). Despite theming her brand around wolves, she sincerely believes they’re mythical creatures that never actually existed, and will not believe any evidence to the contrary, up to and including living wolves on dozens of Core worlds. As a trans woman and a refugee from Nestor, she’s become somewhat of a folk hero to Nestorians: one of their own, out there in the stars, thriving despite being the exact sort of person the Forefront wanted dead. She’s very vocal about her heritage, and often lends her voice to the cause of the Nestorian diaspora, both in Union and in Calliope. When not in the cockpit, she can be found gambling her winnings in the Icebreaker’s casinos, doing promotional work for her various sponsors, or working out.

EVELINA BONDARCHUK 
SHE/HER 
OWNER OF THE GIFT-BRONZE CASINO 
A regal woman with a taste for elegant and complex dresses. She’s never seen without a cigarette in a long holder, but never seems to actually light or smoke it. She’s spent years cultivating an air of mystery and allure largely just to see if she could; she’s uninterested in actual intimacy or romantic involvement. As a casino proprietor and a member of the Board, Evelina is no stranger to intrigue. She’s become exceptionally good at navigating the Icebreaker’s brutal, cut-throat politics, but she has an extra secret: she’s thrown in with Ignatius Aurum and the Inner Cult. Evelina’s primary advantage is that she possesses all the strengths of a Board member and almost none of their usual weaknesses. She has immense wealth, prestige and access, and she’s intimately familiar with how to navigate the short-sighted greed and vicious social games of the other Board members. But she’s no longer in a chaotic free-for-all: she has a definite goal, and allies whom she can trust.

VIMALA “MISS HIGH ROLLER” PREMJANI 
Her main claim to fame is being banned from every casino on the Icebreaker. They say she’s a cheat. She insists she’s just good at counting cards and weighing probabilities. Since she can’t make money gambling anymore, she offers divination with tarot cards, which is inexplicably reliable. 

3-4 PLACEHOLDER MCPLACEHOLDERSON PLACEHOLDER 

5-6 TALON KYLE DIAMZON MECHANIC 
A wrenchie who got fired from his job at Impact Dynamics for sneaking repair supplies to “the poors,” and so took his services to the Icebreaker. Has a massive charitable streak, and spends as much time fixing things for free as he does for pay. 

7-8 SUBTEXT ÍSFÛR COWARDS 
An argumentative philosopher who got stuck on the Icebreaker when their colony ship left without them for some reason. Subtext makes a living giving philosophy lectures, as they (allegedly) have teaching qualifications. While their debate style is often needlessly aggressive, they make a compelling point about how a lot of academic philosophy has become “navel-gazing bullshit that’s lost touch with the day-to-day struggles people in the real world experience.” 

9-10 ISHIHARA YAEKO 
A painter suffering from a long artistic block. She’s searching for new inspiration, and if any of the PCs capture her attention, she’ll begin asking about their experiences and trying to spend time with them. If she gets to know a PC, she’ll share something personal: ever since she came to Calliope, she’s been having recurring nightmares of her wife dying. Just one problem: she’s not and has never been married. 

11-12 JÓN JÓNSSON 
A smart-looking businesswoman who insists she’s just taking an “extended vacation” on the Icebreaker, which has lasted about a decade so far. Despite the fact that she doesn’t seem to have a job, she never seems to be short of cash, and can be found in the station’s mid-market casinos, making low-cost wagers and sipping high-cost drinks. If a PC earns her trust, it turns out she’s a grey-market fixer, and is happy to hook them up with interested clients or vendors. 

13-14 YELDA ERGUN 
Wait, the Yelda Ergun? From Yelda and the Minesweepers? The pop sensation that swept musical awards five albums running? The multi-instrumentalist virtuoso whose posters graced the bedroom walls of half the teenagers in Union? What’s she doing working as a barista in a crummy cafe in the Long Rim? Well, she says, burnout’s a motherfucker. Add in a control freak manager, an argument with a bandmate that turned violent, the paparazzi and a literal cult of obsessive stalkers, and running away became less about luxury and more about necessity. Now, can she please just take your order? 

15-16 RAT 
Pierced in every place you can imagine (and, he assures you, some you can’t), covered in tattoos, with his hair dyed any number of colors, Rat cuts an imposing figure despite his short stature. He originally turned to sex work to cover the cost of his gender confirmation surgery, but found that not only did he enjoy the profession, there were a lot of people in it who needed solidarity. Sex work on the Icebreaker has never been easy, but at least if you ask “Little Rat Boy” for help, he can make certain problems – like abusive clients or pushy debt collectors – go away. 

17-18 ANTHONY “CAL” CALLAHAN 
A scruffy man with long brown hair and a green spiral tattooed around his left eye. He wears a bullet on a chain around his neck, speaks in an older dialect of Union Common, and has the haunted, suspicious look of someone on the run from the authorities. Always wears a fingerless glove on his left hand, apparently to conceal something. Makes a living doing sleight of hand and magic tricks that genuinely seem to be impossible. 

19-20 SIDAR OMÊD AUGHT-TEN-SIX 
An older man with some gnarly facial scars; energy weapon, maybe? He’s an electrical engineer, and part of Fayad Harb’s engineering union, but is much more radical than Harb. There are some rumors that connect him to unauthorized industrial sabotage – only rumors, mind, but he never denies them.
