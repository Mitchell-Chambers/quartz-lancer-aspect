Calliope has no official language, but they do have a system-local dialect of Union Common. It’s spoken faster than baseline UC, with fewer conjunctions, simplified pronunciation and a vast array of loan words from other languages. Those used to another dialect of UC might need a little bit of time to get used to it, but it’s meant to be easy to pick up. There’s no “standard” accent, but most people will be able to tell where you live by how you pronounce “Calliope.” Calliopean sign language is based loosely on Union Common sign language, and is signed one-handed. Most adults know enough to hold a conversation, although maintenance personnel learn it fully, in order to facilitate communication in very loud or completely soundless environments.
