There’s a riddle, a century and a half old: why are the elves so interested in Calliope? ^summary

At first glance, it seems like a contradiction; the Conclave isn't interested in Calliope. It ditched its stake in the region during the Second Shift like every other big empire, and most of its tributaries don’t operate anywhere in the Far Planes. In fact, of all the various unpleasant imperial influences Calliope has to deal with, the Conclave is least prominent among them. So why do they maintain an embassy here at all? Why are so many of their goods available in Calliope, at great cost to their nation, when almost nobody here is rich enough to afford them? Why does it co-fund an entire frame fighting league with the Imperium? There’s got to be some reason the Conclave is hanging around. If confronted with this evidence, most Calliopeans will shrug, remark that it’s probably just “their usual weird elven eugenics shit” and get on with their day – they’ve got bigger things to worry about. 

Calliopeans from the Conclave (“Connies”) are a small but notable group, easily distinguishable from their peers in that they seem to be a lot wealthier than others, whether in money or functional goods.
