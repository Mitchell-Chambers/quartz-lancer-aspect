Part labour guild, part magic-socialist committee, part mutual aid group, Hell’s Gate Outpost works as hard as it can to meet the needs of the Gate’s people, and these needs are considerable. ^summary

Hell’s Gate has the second largest population of the Big Four Cities, but is by far the poorest. While the City's promise to never tax its citizens for the basic essentials of life is noble, its revenue streams are low. The city's beloved magistrate, Bai Zexian, vanished about three years ago, leaving the city's previous militia commander, Jerry Masters, as acting magistrate. Jerry is a kind and well-meaning man who genuinely wants the best for the city and its inhabitants, but he’s neurotic, anxious and somewhat unprepared for the burden of city and outpost governance. He gets little sleep, is constantly overworked, and has few support staff other than his devoted *Asura* NHP, Shelly. A few people accuse Jerry of refusing to hold a byelection out of a lust for power, but the truth is there’s no-one else running for the position. Nothing would please Jerry more than to quit this job, but it really seems like if he won’t do it, nobody will. Hell’s Gate Outpost really is in a tough spot.
Also, you work for them.
Good luck.
