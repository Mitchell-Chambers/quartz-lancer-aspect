# JERRY MASTERS
#### INTERIM CITY MAGISTRATE
##### HUMAN MALE
Jerry Masters used to lead the Gate’s elite guard, but he took the role of acting city magistrate when the city’s previous magistrate, Bai Zexian, vanished three years ago – although it’s more accurate to say that everyone else stepped back. A pale, short, thin man with an untidy mop of brown hair and a twitchy disposition, Jerry doesn’t cut a convincing figure. This isn’t helped by his anxiety, his crippling insomnia or his selection of atrocious novelty vests. He always seems to be about thirty seconds away from a nervous breakdown. Under Jerry’s administration, people don’t get very much, but what they’re entitled to, they always get, no matter what. On top of that, Jerry was – likely still is – a top-shelf Chosen. He never talks about his past, but the half-dismantled Sherman in the courtyard had to come from somewhere. An old title sometimes gets whispered in the Gate’s bars by militia members: *Daybreak*, and when the empty mugs really start to stack up, rumors fly...
