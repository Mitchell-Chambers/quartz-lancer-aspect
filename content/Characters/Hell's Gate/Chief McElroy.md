# CHIEF MCELROY
#### HEAD ARTIFICER 
##### 'HALFLING' FEMALE
If McElroy has a first name, either nobody ever uses it or it’s actually “Chief.” A bulky, muscular, dark-skinned woman with close-shaven black hair, a large ocular implant replacing her left eye and a pair of tertiary arms, Chief Engineer McElroy can usually be found smeared in grease and wielding a power tool. Most days, she’s neck-deep in the business of managing the wrenchies and ensuring Hell’s Gate still has air, water and lights. Never one to shy away from hard work, she leads from the front, usually being the first to clock in for shifts and the last to clock out. In truth, she would’ve been a better choice than Jerry to replace Director Bai, and everyone knows it. But everyone also knew that removing her from her current post would be a disaster. Nobody knows their way around the Gate like she does, and losing her handson expertise wasn’t something the station could afford. Despite the pressure placed upon her by her towering work schedule, she’s usually level-headed and rarely loses her cool. Since the recent debacle with the printer, however, she’s become sterner, punishing breaches of maintenance protocol she previously let slide. She’s also made a dire “promise” that, should the printer ever work again, anyone who submits a fabrication without triple-checking it first “will wanna get good at spacewalking real quick.”
