# STRIGA VON ALDENBERG 
#### FELICITATIONS, COMRADES!
##### ORC FEMALE
Striga Von Aldenberg is the eccentric and paranoid leader of “The Truth,” a tight clique of equally eccentric and paranoid sigdivers, vaguely aligned with Horizon. Striga is a tall, rail -thin, olive -skinned woman in her mid - 20s, recognizable by her scruffy, tattered clothing, her squirely demeanor, her wild hair, unnaturally wide eyes (usually sporting dark bags from lack of sleep) and her tendency to appear suddenly and without warning from places she shouldn’t physically be able to occupy. She runs on energy drinks and trusts only one convenience store on the other side of the station. Whenever she runs out, she makes “the pilgrimage” all the way from one hab ring to the other to get a new batch, often accompanied by her clique. Judging by their infamous “all -night marathon dance music and gaming parties,” she and the clique are no strangers to stims either. Despite all the quirks, her crew are the station’s most reliable source for obscure data, esoteric software and information retrieval. However, anyone who wants their services is going to have to earn the group’s trust first. This usually means either listening to Striga ramble about her latest conspiracy theory for a couple of hours, or enacting some outlandish prank the clique devises.
