# SHELLY
#### ADMINISTRATIVE NHP
##### ASURA 'FEMALE'
Shelly is Jerry’s former co-pilot, the ASURA-class NHP that came with his Sherman. Since it’s currently acting as an auxiliary mana storage for the Weaver, she took on a new role as Jerry’s assistant, aiding him in the monumental task of keeping the city afloat.

## THE TRUTH
Shelly has an efficient, pragmatic perspective, shot through with an arrogant streak, and maintains a polite but chilly detachment from all but a few residents of Hell’s Gate. She’s deeply passive-aggressive towards those she deems to be a bad influence on Jerry. Shelly does not usually provide a visual representation of herself. On the occasions that she does, she projects the image of a smart, youngish woman with glasses, which she continually pushes up when she wants to be condescending. Shelly has an odd fixation: a burning desire to “actually eat food, once, you know? It looks like a fascinating experience.” If not otherwise pre-empted, Shelly has a tendency to assign food-based names to missions, ships and fireteams.
