# IPSWITCH "SWITCH" DELACEY
#### ILLUSIONIST SENSATION
##### GNOME MALE
Thin and pale, with their hair bleached platinum white, Ipswich “Switch” DeLacey is a loud, extroverted bundle of energy. They appeared on the station a few years ago, and promptly took up the career of “lifestyle Omninet streamer.” Since then, Switch and their fleet of camera drones have become a common sight. The fact that they’re often broadcasting live footage of the station’s inner workings and day-to-day events poses a minor security issue for Jerry. It’s likely he’d have shut the whole racket down a while back, were Ipswich not putting half of their stream’s donation money into the station’s discretionary budget. They’re a member of and point of contact for the Horizon Collective – although this seems to be a fact that Ipswich just decided was true, and Horizon grudgingly had to accept. Nonetheless, Ipswich does have a few useful acquaintances in the organization they can put people in touch with. If the PCs seem interesting or cool, Ipswich will try to spend time with them, interview them, or even ride along with them on a mission if one of them has an expanded compartment. Jerry will refuse to authorize this, but there’s little he can actually do to stop the PCs if they take Switch up on this. Switch has a secret; they’re actually Baldur Valentinian, the long-lost son of renowned Armory blinkspace researcher Dr. Odin Valentinian. More information can be found on p. .
