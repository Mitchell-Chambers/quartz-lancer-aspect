# ZINFANDEL DEJEAN
#### MILITIA COMMANDER 
##### HUMAN MALE
“Zinfandel DeJean” likely isn’t their birth name, but this is the Long Rim. Folks out here often come up with names in a split second based on what they can see, so people tend to assume they either had a fun night in someone else’s cabin or got asked their name in a store that sold wine and trousers. Tall and heavyset, with their sea-green dreadlocks pulled back in a ponytail, Zinfandel cuts an imposing figure to those who first meet them. However, this impression quickly melts away in the face of their boisterous attitude and crude but good-natured sense of humor. They have a whimsical outlook on life, and are prone to pithy, blunt observations. Some of these “DeJeanisms” have dug themselves into the local culture of Hell’s Gate. Zinfandel inherited command of the local militia from Jerry when he became acting director. By all accounts they’re a much better unit leader than he was, but they have yet to match his piloting skill. Their favored mech is an IPS-N Drake named *Now Where Did I Leave That.*
