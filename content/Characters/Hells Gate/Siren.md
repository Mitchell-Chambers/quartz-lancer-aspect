# SIREN
#### PILOT NHP
##### ALKONOST 'FEMALE'
Siren is an ALKONOST-class flight operations NHP, salvaged from a derelict SecComm strategic bomber just over two decades ago. After a lengthy and troubled rehabilitation, she drifted around Union, out to the Long Rim, and eventually found herself in Calliope. During an absence of qualified pilots, Siren was given flight control of the Dragon’s Tooth, one of the Gate’s subline corvettes. She excelled in the role, and continues to fill it to this day, ferrying the Strategic Response Team between jobs. As a military asset under SecComm, she cultivated the stern, impatient attitude of a drill sergeant, but in the present era, with the novel experience of being treated as a person instead of a weapon, she demonstrates a more level-headed, outgoing attitude. She has a habit of flipping between these expressions suddenly, often while under stress. She also calls the team “marines,” no matter how many times they ask her to stop. Her casket has eleven tally marks on its casing, but she doesn’t know what they mean. Chained to it is a folder containing emergency protocols in the event of a cascade, and an ad-hoc Balwinder-Bolaño schedule. At the start of the campaign, she’s just about to come off a cycle, and should be stable for the next six years. 
*Can an magically bound outsider be a deserter? Siren doesn't think so, she remains loyal to her cause and whatever boat she finds herself on. Even if the [[Imperium of Man]] lost their taste for war a long time ago, Siren hasn't.*
